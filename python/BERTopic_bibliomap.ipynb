growth, it inevitably also has an impact on the ecological environment. this research explores the relationship between uir and ecological footprint based on data of 72 countries from 1993 to 2019. first, whether based on overall or sub-industry data we confirm that uir reduces the ecological footprint. after considering a series of robustness tests such as sample self-selection bias and endogeneity, this conclusion still holds. second, the mediation effect model shows that uir reduces the ecological footprint through the time saving effect, green employment effect, and energy upgrading effect and increases the ecological footprint through the industry driving effect, and that the impact of uir's reduction of the ecological footprint is dominant. third, the moderating effect model shows that as the levels of economic development and human capital increase, uir can more effectively reduce the ecological footprint. fourth, in oecd countries and at a high quantile of the ecological footprint, the effect of uir on reducing the ecological footprint is more obvious. this paper presents a new perspective for uir to achieve economic development and ecological protection at the same time. governments of various countries should actively seize the opportunity to develop industrial robots, continue to increase human capital investment, and accelerate the upgrade of energy sectors.\",\"a comprehensive review of the evolving and cumulative nature of eco-innovation in the chemical industry. different bodies of literature have attempted to explain what factors and events drive industries throughout processes of environmental change. the latter is a gradual, historical process of evolution from lower to higher degrees of development. based on concepts derived from evolutionary economics, greening technological progress and resource-based view of the firm, this article informs the sustainability transitions literature by providing an account of the evolution in the chemical industry's striving for the design, use and production of environmentally sound chemical processes and products based upon eco-innovation. a conceptual model was elaborated depicting five stages of environmental change in the chemical industry in the period 1901-2030. the authors empirically tested this model by conducting a longitudinal computer-aided content analysis of 255 documents addressing different environmental and innovation aspects in this industry in the same period of time. the results of this article advance our modern understanding of the different stages of evolution of the chemical industry in terms of environmental change. consistent with the conceptual model hitherto presented, the findings of this article highlight a number cumulative of factors that enabled the evolution of the chemical industry throughout time supporting eco-innovation, highlighting the intertwined nature of regulation, innovation, and technological change. it is plausible that the future development of this industry might be shaped by the policy-driven paradigms of sustainability and resource efficiency.\",\"applying artificial intelligence in physical education and future perspectives. artificial intelligence (ai) is gradually influencing every aspect of everyday life, including education. ai can also provide special support to learners through academic sustainability or discontinuation predictions. while ai research remains in its early stages, we must examine how it evolves and exerts its potential over time. by utilizing ai in physical education (pe), we can increase its potential use in sports applications, and enact changes upon the nature of pe, its visualization, and repeatability. based on the concept of ai and related research areas, this study explores its principles and use in pe, and presents a focused, in-depth analysis of the areas of pe technology where ai could be applied-customized pe classes, knowledge provision, learner evaluation, and learner counseling methods. our findings highlight the expertise required for future pe teachers in applying ai. regarding practice implications, this study addresses the topic of ai innovations affecting all life domains, including pe; it highlights ai applications\\u2019 relevance to pe technology, based on existing research; it proposes that the implications of ai for pe may apply to other educational domains; and finally, it contributes to existing literature and also shares future research prospects regarding ai applications in education and sports.\",\"digital economy in the uk: regional productivity effects of early adoption. whilst the importance of internet-related technologies and digitization practices to economic performance is well documented, little is known about the long-term effects of the early adoption of such technologies. we use novel, geolocated data about the volume of online content from the internet archive to approximate the active engagement with digital economic activities. using panel-data methods, we find significant positive and long-lasting effects of online content creation in 2000 on subsequent regional productivity levels up to 16 years later. our findings highlight the sizeable effects of the digital economy that policy-makers should consider when developing future rollout strategies.\",\"linking technology intelligence to open innovation. the explosive growth of the internet has led to a dramatic increase in data sources for (competitive) technology intelligence. appropriate implementation and use of it tools to gather and analyze these data is of key importance for the creation of actionable technology intelligence. a strategy to optimize investments in the identified technologies becomes of paramount importance if an organization wants to match knowledge and ideas originating from outside of the organization with internal core competences. such a strategy can create competitive advantage by effectively linking technology intelligence to open innovation. we show how vib, a life sciences research organization, has established technology intelligence processes to identify a multitude of external technologies of interest, which are subsequently \\\"probed\\\" for their potential and fit with vib using real options reasoning, thereby supporting open innovation. our methodology may be useful for other organizations which are considering implementing open innovation approaches.\",\"a bibliometric review of research on stem education in asean: science mapping the literature in scopus database, 2000 to 2019. in recent years, science, technology, engineering, and math (stem) education has become important in many countries around the world. in this study a bibliometric analysis was applied to evaluate the scientific results of stem education in the association of southeast asian nations (asean) region, indexed in the scopus database for the period 2000-2019. a total of 175 publications were taken from the scopus database for analysis. our main findings show that the trend of research in this field has shown a dramatic increase in scientific production in the last three years, when the published amount accounted for 67.43% of the collection. authors with the most publications came from the top 10 universities and research institutes (accounting for 38.44%). scholars in the asean region tend to submit their works to q3 and q4 journals in the scimago database. diverse research with basic and cross-cutting topics focus on stem education for undergraduate students, engineering education, and education computing.\",\"the welfare effects of social media\\u2020. the rise of social media has provoked both optimism about potential societal benefits and concern about harms such as addiction, depression, and political polarization. in a randomized experiment, we find that deactivating facebook for the four weeks before the 2018 us midterm election (i) reduced online activity, while increasing offline activities such as watching tv alone and socializing with family and friends; (ii) reduced both factual news knowledge and political polarization; (iii) increased subjective well-being; and (iv) caused a large persistent reduction in post-experiment facebook use. deactivation reduced post-experiment valuations of facebook, suggesting that traditional metrics may overstate consumer surplus.\",\"established sectors expediting clean technology industries? the norwegian oil and gas sector's influence on offshore wind power. the development and deployment of clean technologies must be accelerated to avoid a more than 2-degree warmer world. redeployment of the vast resources concentrated in established sectors is one possible way to advance cleantech industries. however, prior research on sustainability transitions tends to emphasize competition and conflict between established sectors and cleantech industries. there is thus a need for exploring in more depth how established sectors may positively contribute to cleantech industries. based on the notion of structural overlaps, we propose an extended version of the technological innovation systems framework to study how established sectors influence cleantech industries, and present new conceptual definitions and indicators. we apply the framework to a case study of the relationship between the oil and gas sector and the offshore wind power industry in norway. our empirical results show that the oil and gas sector has several positive influences on offshore wind power enabled by technological overlaps and diversifying firms. however, misaligned informal institutions weaken such influences, manifested as e.g. conflicting priorities and wavering commitment of diversified oil and gas firms to the new industry. we conclude by discussing the usefulness of the proposed framework and the relevance of our findings for policy and further research.\",\"does the smart city policy promote the green growth of the urban economy? evidence from china. urban governance is an important cornerstone in the modernization of a national governance system. the establishment of smart cities driven by digitalization will be a vital way to promote economic green and sustainable growth. by using the data of 274 prefecture-level cities in china from 2004 to 2017, we study the impact of smart city policy on economic green growth and the underlying mechanism of the impact. it is shown that the establishment of smart cities has significantly promoted the green growth of china\\u2019s economy. this conclusion is further confirmed by using exogenous geographic data as instrumental variables and robustness tests, such as the quasi-experimental method of difference in difference with propensity score matching (pam-did). the mechanism test shows that promoting economic growth, reducing per unit gdp energy consumption, and lowering waste emissions represent three ways for smart cities to promote green economic growth. the heterogeneity test shows that smart city policy has an obvious promotional effect on the economic green growth of both large cities and non-resource-based cities. this paper is expected to provide a reference for the urban development and economic transformation of emerging economies.\",\"emotional intelligence or artificial intelligence\\u2013 an employee perspective. emotional intelligence as personal intelligence and artificial intelligence as a machine intelligence have been popular in the relevant literature over the last two decades. the current study integrates these two concepts and explores how emotional and artificial intelligence influences employee retention and performance with a focus on service employees in the hotel industry. employee performance is operationalised into internal and external dimensions that captures employees\\u2019 task efficiency over both internal and external service encounters with co-workers and customers respectively. the data were collected from a variety of different ranking hotels. the results show that emotional intelligence has a significant effect on employee retention and performance; whereas artificial intelligence plays a significant moderating role in employee performance. a discussion of the findings and implications concludes this paper.\",\"role of big data analytics in developing sustainable capabilities. the purpose of this study is to examine the extent of sustainable capabilities driven by corporate commitment resulting from the integration of big data technologies, green supply chain management, and green human resource management practices, and the extent to which these capabilities can enhance the broader firm performance. the study was also designed to investigate the degree to which green human resource management practices influence the integration of big data technologies with processes and enhance the relationships between green supply chain management practices, both internal and external, as well as their influence on sustainable performance. we used dynamic capabilities theory and proposed a conceptual research model which was tested empirically. the findings of our study establish the influence of big data driven strategies on business growth in terms of sustainable performance by considering internal processes that constitute sustainable capabilities. the study recommends the integration of green supply chain management, green human resource management practices, and big data management to enhance firms\\u2019 sustainable capabilities that lead to better sustainable performance.\",\"from data to action: how marketers can leverage ai. artificial intelligence (ai) is at the forefront of a revolution in business and society. ai affords companies a host of ways to better understand, predict, and engage customers. within marketing, ai's adoption is increasing year-on-year and in varied contexts, from providing service assistance during customer interactions to assisting in the identification of optimal promotions. but just as questions about ai remain with regard to job automation, ethics, and corporate responsibility, the marketing domain faces its own concerns about ai. with this article, we seek to consolidate the growing body of knowledge about ai in marketing. we explain how ai can enhance the marketing function across nine stages of the marketing planning process. we also provide examples of current applications of ai in marketing.\",\"one-voice strategy for customer engagement. machine-age technologies, including automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence, are profoundly expanding the variety of service interfaces and therefore the possible ways that customers and firms can interact across customer journeys. this expansion challenges service firms\\u2019 capabilities to deliver coherent streams of interactions for effective customer engagement. this article develops a conceptual framework of firm capabilities that enable firms to operate with \\u201cone voice\\u201d to deliver seamless, harmonious, and reliable interactions across diverse interfaces in a customer journey. the proposed framework integrates three themes: (1) service interaction space to capture the interrelationship among devices, interfaces, interactions, and journeys; (2) learning and coordination as core capabilities for generating and using intelligence, respectively, to enhance customer engagement in subsequent interactions; and (3) one-voice strategy to configure learning and coordination capabilities in combinations that meet conditions of fitness and equifinality for effective customer engagement. we provide several research questions and priorities to guide research and practice.\",\"do we trust in ai? role of anthropomorphism and intelligence. ai applications are radically transforming the manner in which service providers and consumers interact. we explore how the humanness of ai applications affects consumers\\u2019 trust in these applications. qualitative evidence collected with focus groups provides fresh insights into the roles of anthropomorphism and intelligence, as key constructs representing humanness. our findings reveal the consumers\\u2019 perspective on the nuances of these constructs pertaining to services enabled by ai applications. it also extends current understanding of the phenomenon of the \\u201cuncanny valley,\\u201d by identifying conditions under which consumers experience discomfort and uneasiness as ai humanness increases in service environments.\",\"mapping between design activities and external representations for engineering student designers. many design researchers have attempted to characterize design through the different activities the designer exhibits, such as problem framing, solution generation, and evaluating alternative solutions. others have documented the way that sketching supports design. this study combines these approaches to understanding design by exploring the interplay between designers' representations and their design activities in a set of four case studies. we analyzed verbal protocols collected from two senior and two freshman engineering students. the four students exemplify the significant design activity findings from a previous study. in this paper, we present the results from the analysis of the four design protocols, focusing on the relationship between representation and design activity, and on differences between the freshmen and seniors in our sample in the way that they make and use design sketches. we discuss these findings with a focus on improving design education.\",\"hotel managers\\u2019 perceptions towards the use of robots: a mixed-methods approach. adopting a supply-side perspective, the paper analyses bulgarian hotel managers\\u2019 perceptions of service robots using a convergent mixed methods design. structured quantitative data were collected from 79 managers using a questionnaire, while interviews were used for the collection of qualitative data from 20 managers. the findings indicate respondents feel that repetitive, dirty, dull, and dangerous tasks in hotels would be more appropriate for robots, while hotel managers would rather use employees for tasks that require social skills and emotional intelligence. the individual characteristics of respondents and the organisational characteristics of the hotels they currently worked in played little role in their perceptions of service robots. the managers considered that robots would decrease the quality of the service and were generally not ready to use robots. additionally, the interviewees indicated that skilled and well-trained employees were more valuable and more adequate than robots for the hospitality and tourism industry. theoretical and managerial implications are provided as well.\",\"a qualitative study of user perceptions of mobile health apps. background: mobile apps for health exist in large numbers today, but oftentimes, consumers do not continue to use them after a brief period of initial usage, are averse toward using them at all, or are unaware that such apps even exist. the purpose of our study was to examine and qualitatively determine the design and content elements of health apps that facilitate or impede usage from the users' perceptive. methods: in 2014, six focus groups and five individual interviews were conducted in the midwest region of the u.s. with a mixture of 44 smartphone owners of various social economic status. the participants were asked about their general and health specific mobile app usage. they were then shown specific features of exemplar health apps and prompted to discuss their perceptions. the focus groups and interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using the software nvivo. results: inductive thematic analysis was adopted to analyze the data and nine themes were identified: 1) barriers to adoption of health apps, 2) barriers to continued use of health apps, 3) motivators, 4) information and personalized guidance, 5) tracking for awareness and progress, 6) credibility, 7) goal setting, 8) reminders, and 9) sharing personal information. the themes were mapped to theories for interpretation of the results. conclusions: this qualitative research with a diverse pool of participants extended previous research on challenges and opportunities of health apps. the findings provide researchers, app designers, and health care providers insights on how to develop and evaluate health apps from the users' perspective.\",\"artificial intelligence (ai) in strategic marketing decision-making: a research agenda. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to review literature about the applications of artificial intelligence (ai) in strategic situations and identify the research that is needed in the area of applying ai to strategic marketing decisions. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the approach was to carry out a literature review and to consult with marketing experts who were invited to contribute to the paper. findings: there is little research into applying ai to strategic marketing decision-making. this research is needed, as the frontier of ai application to decision-making is moving in many management areas from operational to strategic. given the competitive nature of such decisions and the insights from applying ai to defence and similar areas, it is time to focus on applying ai to strategic marketing decisions. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the application of ai to strategic marketing decision-making is known to be taking place, but as it is commercially sensitive, data is not available to the authors. practical implications: there are strong implications for all businesses, particularly large businesses in competitive industries, where failure to deploy ai in the face of competition from firms, who have deployed ai to improve their decision-making could be dangerous. social implications: the public sector is a very important marketing decision maker. although in most cases it does not operate competitively, it must make decisions about making different services available to different citizens and identify the risks of not providing services to certain citizens; so, this paper is relevant to the public sector. originality\\u002fvalue: to the best of the authors\\u2019 knowledge, this is one of the first papers to probe deployment of ai in strategic marketing decision-making.\",\"how does it affect design centricity approaches: evidence from spain's smart tourism ecosystem. little or no prior work has examined how information technology enables the development of a design centered digital ecosystem. to examine this research question, we employ a capabilities lens and identify the pathways through which it drives the development of a design centric smart tourism ecosystem. we analyzed archival data and data collected from interviews conducted in spain, a country which has embarked on smart destinations projects and topped the world economic forum's travel and competitiveness index. from our analysis, we delineate and identify specific it-enabled capabilities important for a country implementing smart tourism projects. we find that many of the it resources available help develop key capabilities necessary for creating a design centric smart tourism ecosystem.\",\"concept blending and dissimilarity: factors for creative concept generation process. we approached the concept generation stage in design within the framework of a concept-synthesizing process from two base concepts. we analyzed the concept generation process by comparing it with the linguistic interpretation process, from the viewpoints of thought types (property mapping, blending, and thematic relation) and recognition types (commonalities and alignable and nonalignable differences). subjects interpreted a novel noun-noun phrase, designed a new concept from it, and listed the similarities and dissimilarities between the nouns. blending (i.e. generating a new concept that is not included in the two base concepts but that inherits certain characteristics of the concepts) and nonalignable differences (i.e. the recognized differences that are unrelated to the common structure) characterize the creative concept generation process.\",\"technology in tourism-from information communication technologies to etourism and smart tourism towards ambient intelligence tourism: a perspective article. purpose: technology

intelligence in operations management and supply chain management: an exploratory case study. with the development and evolution of information technology, competition has become more and more intensive on a global scale. many companies have forecast that the future of operation and supply chain management (scm) may change dramatically, from planning, scheduling, optimisation, to transportation, with the presence of artificial intelligence (ai). people will be more and more interested in machine learning, ai, and other intelligent technologies, in terms of scm. within this context, this particular research study provides an overview of the concept of ai and scm. it then focuses on timely and critical analysis of ai-driven supply chain research and applications. in this exploratory research, the emerging ai-based business models of different case companies are analysed. their relevant ai solutions and related values to companies are also evaluated. as a result, this research identifies several areas of value creation for the application of ai in the supply chain. it also proposes an approach to designing business models for ai supply chain applications.\",\"what makes you continuously use chatbot services? evidence from chinese online travel agencies. thanks to artificial intelligence, chatbots have been applied to many consumer-facing applications, especially to online travel agencies (otas). this study aims to identify five quality dimensions of chatbot services and investigate their effect on user confirmation, which in turn leads to use continuance. in addition, the moderating role of technology anxiety in the relationships between chatbot quality dimensions and post-use confirmation is examined. survey data were gathered from 295 users of chinese otas. partial least square (pls) was used to analyze measurement and structural models. understandability, reliability, assurance, and interactivity are positively associated with post-use confirmation and technology anxiety moderates the relationships between four chatbot quality dimensions and confirmation. confirmation is positively associated with satisfaction, which in turn influences use continuance intention. this study examines how chatbot services in otas are considered by users (human-like agents vs. technology-enabled services) by investigating the moderating role of technology anxiety.\",\"linking ai quality performance and customer engagement: the moderating effect of ai preference. drawing upon affordance theory, this study positions artificial intelligence (ai) as a commercial service in examining its influence on customer engagement in the hotel context. in particular, we seek to understand linkages between customer perceptions of ai service quality, ai customer satisfaction and engagement. given the multiplicity of services offered by service organisations, customers\\u2019 preference for ai service is modelled as a moderator of customer perceptions and attitudes towards ai. data was collected from a sample of hotel customers in australia who had previously used ai tools or services. our results reveal a significant chain effect between ai service indicators, service quality perceptions, ai satisfaction and customer engagement. ai preference has a significant moderation effect on information quality and satisfaction. these findings provide new insights into the consumer services literature and have important implications for marketing practitioners.\",\"exploring consumers' response to text-based chatbots in e-commerce: the moderating role of task complexity and chatbot disclosure. purpose: artificial intelligence (ai)-based chatbots have brought unprecedented business potential. this study aims to explore consumers' trust and response to a text-based chatbot in e-commerce, involving the moderating effects of task complexity and chatbot identity disclosure. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a survey method with 299 useable responses was conducted in this research. this study adopted the ordinary least squares regression to test the hypotheses. findings: first, the consumers' perception of both the empathy and friendliness of the chatbot positively impacts their trust in it. second, task complexity negatively moderates the relationship between friendliness and consumers' trust. third, disclosure of the text-based chatbot negatively moderates the relationship between empathy and consumers' trust, while it positively moderates the relationship between friendliness and consumers' trust. fourth, consumers' trust in the chatbot increases their reliance on the chatbot and decreases their resistance to the chatbot in future interactions. research limitations\\u002fimplications: adopting the stimulus\\u2013organism\\u2013response (sor) framework, this study provides important insights on consumers' perception and response to the text-based chatbot. the findings of this research also make suggestions that can increase consumers' positive responses to text-based chatbots. originality\\u002fvalue: extant studies have investigated the effects of automated bots' attributes on consumers' perceptions. however, the boundary conditions of these effects are largely ignored. this research is one of the first attempts to provide a deep understanding of consumers' responses to a chatbot.\",\"adoption of digital payment systems in the era of demonetization in india: an empirical study. purpose: this study aims to investigate the actual usage (au) of digital payment systems by the consumers during the period of demonetization (from november 9, 2016 to december 30, 2016) in india. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the conceptual frame work for this study is based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut 2) and innovation resistance theory. a total of 766 sample respondents were surveyed using a pre-tested questionnaire. the empirical validation of the framework and analysis was done using partial least squares (pls)-structural equation modeling (sem) technique. findings: the results suggest that the behavioral intention (bi) to use and innovation resistance (ir) affect the usage of digital payment systems. the relation between bi to use digital payment systems and the au of digital payment systems is moderated by the stickiness to cash payments. research limitations\\u002fimplications: this cross-sectional study is limited by geographic constraints and highlights the au of digital payment systems by using the utaut 2 and ir theory only during the demonetization period. practical implications: this study offers valuable insights to the economists, policymakers and digital payment service providers regarding the usage of digital payment systems by consumers during demonetization. originality\\u002fvalue: this study assumes importance as it empirically examines the influence of bi and ir on the au of digital payment systems during the demonetization period in india. this study empirically validates the moderating influence of stickiness to cash payments on the au of digital payment systems.\",\"industry 4.0, quality management and tqm world. a systematic literature review and a proposed agenda for further research. purpose: the main purpose of this paper is to analyse the current literature situation in terms of relationships between industry 4.0 and quality management and tqm. the author wanted to understand what topics and issues can be considered the most relevant referring to the so-called quality 4.0, what the literature is missing opening avenues for further research. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this research employed a systematic literature review. in total, 75 papers from different sources were reviewed using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. findings: four categories of topics emerged, namely: creating value within the company through quality (big) data, analytics and artificial intelligence; developing quality 4.0 skills and culture for quality people; customer value co-creation; cyber\\u2013physical systems and erp for quality assurance and control. this paper also tried to understand if there is a definition of quality 4.0 based on determined methods. research limitations\\u002fimplications: systematic literature review could have introduced some limitations in terms of the number and reliability of reviewed papers. probably some interesting papers had been not intentionally missed. practical implications: consultants and managers in developing and implementing their own quality 4.0 models could use many practical and discussed implications concerning i4.0 technologies and quality management. originality\\u002fvalue: this is one of the first papers which employed the systematic literature review for researching industry 4.0, quality management and tqm relationships.\",\"the internet of everything: smart things and their impact on business models. the internet of everything (ioe), connecting people, organizations and smart things, promises to fundamentally change how we live, work and interact, and it may redefine a wide range of industry sectors. this conceptual paper aims to develop a vision of how the ioe may alter business models and the ways in which individuals and organizations create value. we review literature on networked business models and service ecosystems, and show that a clearer understanding is needed of how the ioe will impact on the ways that organizations go about their business at the micro, meso and macro levels. combining this with an inductive, vignette-based approach, we present a new taxonomy of smart things based on their capabilities and their connectivity. we derive their implications for business models and conclude the paper with propositions that form a research agenda for business researchers.\",\"critical success factors for integrating artificial intelligence and robotics. purpose: this paper aims to enlighten stakeholders about critical success factors (csfs) in developing intelligent autonomous systems (iass) by integrating artificial intelligence (ai) with robotics. it suggests a prioritization hierarchy model for building sustainable ecosystem for developing iass. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this paper is based on the existing literature and on the opinion of 15 experts. all the experts have minimum of eight years of experience in ai and related technologies. the csf theory is used as a theoretical lens and total interpretative structure modelling (tism) is used for the prioritization of csfs. findings: developing countries like india could leverage iass and associated technologies for solving different societal problems. policymakers need to develop basic policies regarding data collection, standardized hardware, skilled manpower, funding and start-up culture that can act as building blocks in undertaking sustainable ecosystem for developing iass and implementing national ai strategy. clear-cut regulations need to be in place for the proper functioning of the ecosystem. any technology that can function properly in india has better chances of working at the global level considering the size of the population. research limitations\\u002fimplications: this paper had all its experts from india only, and that makes the limitation of this paper, as there is a possibility that some of the factors identified may not hold same significance in other countries. practical implications: stakeholders will understand the critical factors that are important in developing sustainable ecosystem for iass and what should be the possible order of activities corresponding to each csf. originality\\u002fvalue: the paper is the first of its kind that has used the csf theory and tism methodology for the identification and prioritization of csfs in developing iass. further, eight significant factors, that is, emerging economy multinational enterprises (emnes), governance, utility, manpower, capital, software, data and hardware, have come up as the most important factors in integrating ai with robotics in india.\",\"e-health and wellbeing monitoring using smart healthcare devices: an empirical investigation. according to the united nations sustainable development goal no. 3 (sdg \\u2013 goal 3), for sustainable development it is imperative to ensure health and well-being across all ages, and is achievable only through effective and continuous healthcare monitoring. but in india and other third world countries, healthcare monitoring is poor compared to other countries in the world, in spite of it being affordable. the global healthcare smart wearable healthcare (swh) devices market is expected to rise up at a cagr (compound annual growth rate) of 5.6% and by 2020 it is expected to reach 25 billion (gvr report, 2016). the growing incidences of lifestyle diseases, sedentary lifestyle, busy work schedules, technological advancements in healthcare monitoring devices, and increased usage of remote devicesseems to be some of the important factors fuelling this growth. some of the major players in this segment are abbott laboratories, philips healthcare, life watch, ge healthcare, omron healthcare, siemens healthcare and honeywell international inc. etc. but in spite of the healthcare monitoring devices are being predicted to be technologically innovative and providing advanced as well as basic health care monitoring features and available in various price ranges based on the features, we wanted to empirically study the attitude towards adoption of such devices in india. india has traditionally been having a very lackadaisical attitude towards healthcare monitoring. in such a context, what would be the factors influencing the adoption of swh devices. remote health monitoring can enhance the nature of wellbeing administration and to lessen the aggregate expense in human services by maintaining a strategic distance from pointless hospitalizations and guaranteeing that the individuals who need critical consideration get it sooner. this empirical investigation would provide a detailed insight as to how these wearable internet of things devices would bring about a revolution in the healthcare industry. it would also provide the future prospect of iot devices in this sector and how the probability of increase in its usage can be increased with time. the paper explores intrusiveness (intr), comfort (c), perceived usefulness (pu) and perceived ease of use (eou) of swh devices. the study hypothesized the impact of pu and eou, intr and c on attitude and intention to use towards adoption of swh devices. partial least square structured equation modeling (pls \\u2013 sem) methodology was applied to explore the relationships between the concepts and hypothesis. the data was collected from 273 respondents. the age group of the respondents was between 25 and 40 years. the results indicated that intrusiveness and comfort do not have a significant direct impact on intention to use bi (behavior intention) bi swh devices. at the same time intrusiveness had a significant impact on pu of swh devices and comfort has a strong significant impact on pu and eou of smart wearables. the research has strong implications in the current emerging context of smart wearables, their design and effectiveness. also the research can have lasting implications on elderly health and well-being. there are very few empirical studies in the area of swh devices. most of the studies till now are conceptual studies or providing technology architectures and frameworks. the research in this area is still at a very nascent stage and very few studies have been done to explore the use and adoption of swh devices.\",\"navigating through the complex transport system: a heuristic approach for city tourism recommendation. the fast development of machine learning and artificial intelligence has led to a great improvement of the smart tourism recommendation system, however many problems associated with the choice of transport modes in city tourism have yet to be solved. this research attempts to address this issue by proposing a model of customized day itineraries with consideration of transport mode choice. with improved particle swarm optimization and differential evolution algorithm, a nondominated sorting heuristic approach was devised. a case study was carried out in chengdu, china to examine the performance of our approach. the results show that compared with extant methods, our approach achieves better performance. in addition, our approach can create more sensible, multifarious, and customized itineraries than previous methods. tourism organizations and mobile map app providers could integrate our proposed model into their existing smart service systems, as part of their e-business or digital strategy for enhancing tourist experience.\",\"a framework for collaborative artificial intelligence in marketing. we develop a conceptual framework for collaborative artificial intelligence (ai) in marketing, providing systematic guidance for how human marketers and consumers can team up with ai, which has profound implications for retailing, which is the interface between marketers and consumers. drawing from the multiple intelligences view that ai advances from mechanical, to thinking, to feeling intelligence (based on how difficult for ai to mimic human intelligences), the framework posits that collaboration between ai and hi (human marketers and consumers) can be achieved by 1) recognizing the respective strengths of ai and hi, 2) having lower-level ai augmenting higher-level hi, and 3) moving hi to a higher intelligence level when ai automates the lower level. implications for marketers, consumers, and researchers are derived. marketers should optimize the mix and timing of ai-hi marketing team, consumers should understand the complementarity between ai and hi strengths for informed consumption decisions, and researchers can investigate innovative approaches to and boundary conditions of collaborative intelligence.\",\"morphology analysis for technology roadmapping: application of text mining. the practice of technology roadmapping (trm) has received much attention from researchers and practitioners, to support planning and forecasting in companies and sectors. however, little research has focused on the support of well-organized information for more effective roadmapping and the presentation of in-depth configurations of new products or technology. this paper proposes a roadmapping methodology to assist decision-making by applying a systematic approach based on quantitative data. to this end, key information is extracted from documents such as product manuals and patent documents by text mining, which is then used to identify the morphology of existing products and technology. morphology analysis (ma) also plays a crucial role in deriving promising opportunities for new development of product or technology by matching product and technology morphology. therefore, ma-based trm can enable the effective exploitation of large quantities of significant information that might otherwise be left untapped, supporting innovation by generating a comprehensive set of detailed product and technology configurations. the proposed ma-based trm approach can be applied to both incremental and radical innovation, supporting both market pull and technology push. the method is illustrated with a detailed example for mobile phones to demonstrate its practical application.\",\"realizing the potential of internet of things for smart tourism with 5g and ai. with the development of communication and information technologies, smart tourism is gradually changing the tourism industry. internet of things (iot) plays an important role in smart tourism. however, it is a challenge to apply iot for smart tourism because of the need for dealing with a vast amount of data and low-latency communication. to this end, in this article, we outline 5g and ai-empowered iot systems for smart tourism. efficient data transmission based on 5g technology and smart data processing based on ai technology are significant to unlocking iot based smart tourism applications. to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method, we perform a case study on poi recommendation. the experiment results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed method.\",\"advancing service design research with design science research. purpose: service design is a multidisciplinary approach that is key to service innovation, as it brings new service ideas to life. in this context, the development of new service design methods and models for creating new service futures is an important stream of service design research. such developments can benefit from a systematized research methodology that builds on existing knowledge and robustly evaluates the suitability of research contributions. to address this challenge, the purpose of this paper is to present design science research (dsr), an established methodology from the information systems field, and examine how it can be useful for service design research by supporting the development of new artifacts, such as service design constructs, methods and models. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this paper presents dsr and related literature and shows how dsr can support service design research through a step-by-step approach. a methodology to develop prescriptive-driven solutions for classes of problems, dsr can support service design research in developing rigorous and relevant research. one illustrative example of a service design research effort using the dsr approach is presented. findings: building on dsr\\u2019s robust methodological background, this paper discusses how dsr can support service design research, namely, through the development of new methods and models, and how dsr can be adapted to leverage service design research participatory, iterative, human-centric and creative approach. originality\\u002fvalue: this paper provides an overview of dsr and proposes it as a methodology to conduct service design research, offering step-by-step guidance on the application of dsr in service design research and discussing how it can be adapted according to the specific characteristics of service design research and drive future research.\",\"how ai capabilities enable business model innovation: scaling ai through co-evolutionary processes and feedback loops. artificial intelligence (ai) is predicted to radically transform the ways manufacturing firms create, deliver, and capture value. however, many manufacturers struggle to successfully assimilate ai capabilities into their business models and operations at scale. in this paper, we explore how manufacturing firms can develop ai capabilities and innovate their business models to scale ai in digital servitization. we present empirical insights from a case study of six leading manufacturers engaged in ai. the findings reveal three sets of critical ai capabilities: data pipeline, algorithm development, and ai democratization. to scale these capabilities, firms need to innovate their business models by focusing on agile customer co-creation, data-driven delivery operations, and scalable ecosystem integration. we combine these insights into a co-evolutionary framework for scaling ai through business model innovation underscoring the mechanisms and feedback loops. we offer insights into how manufacturers can scale ai, with important implications for management.\",\"chatbot for smes: integrating customer and business owner perspectives. purpose: chatbots have been widely adopted to create more positive customer experiences as customers now spend more time in digital environments. despite the technological advancement and benefits of chatbots for customer service, research on chatbot applications for small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) is limited. the absence of research explaining the struggles faced by smes contributes to the gap of smes' chatbot adoption. this research determines the features and elements that fit with smes\\u2019 characteristics and their customers with chatbots. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a mixed-methods approach is used to understand smes' needs. study 1 uses interviews with sme business owners and its customers; it aims to explore the features that should be provided by chatbots for sme by identifying combinations between chatbots' generic features and smes' customer characteristics. study 2 tests features identified in study 1 and surveys 315 smes customers to empirically test featured chatbots' influence to anthropomorphism, perceived enjoyment, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and how they affect smes\\u2019 customer intentions to use chatbots and their shopping intentions. findings \\u2013: the findings suggest four combinations of chatbot features that match sme customer characteristics: responsive; simple steps to trigger customer actions; humanized conversations; and personalized recommendations. an experimental survey was designed by creating a chatbot prototype based on these features. the results show that the featured chatbot prototype affects higher anthropomorphism, perceived enjoyment, and perceived usefulness, compared to the standard chatbot. we also find that perceived enjoyment and usefulness positively affect customer's intention to shop and intention to use the chatbot. while anthropomorphism only affect customer's shopping intention to smes. originality: this paper contributes to the emerging service literature on the use of chatbots service interactions, particularly for smes. this research provides robust explorations from the perspective of both sme owners and customers. for practice, the research provides guidelines on how to design a chatbot for smes that meet customers\\u2019 needs.\",\"on the role of computational support for designers in action. designers' actions are high-level mechanisms based on heuristics and assumptions learned from professional experience. significant research has been devoted to understanding these actions as well as finding ways to aid, automate, or augment them with computational support. however, representing and manipulating such tacit knowledge in computational environments remains an open area of research. in this paper, we map designers' actions and relationships to compare them with computational approaches for the generation, evaluation, and selection of design alternatives, and attempt to integrate all of the above. the analysis provides a more thorough understanding of the role of computational approaches in supporting designer actions and identifies challenges and areas of future research.\",\"the impact of artificial intelligence and employee service quality on customer satisfaction and loyalty. the study discusses artificial intelligence (ai)\\u2013powered applications as a commercial service with a focus on the hotel industry. this research is approached from the customers\\u2019 perspective and examines how ai and employee service quality influence customer satisfaction and loyalty. the study was conducted in multiple hotels in portugal and focused on departure guests who had experienced both ai and employee services associated with the surveyed hotels. the results show that both ai and employee service quality explain significant variances in overall service quality assessment as well as customer satisfaction and loyalty. however, only certain service quality dimensions made unique variances in the outcomes of interest. when regressing both ai and employee service quality in the same equation, ai becomes negative and insignificant. this study contributes to the ai and customer loyalty research. the findings of this study have financial implications for hotels and provide insights into optimal resource allocation.\",\"an update on customer value: state of the art, revised typology, and research agenda. purpose: the context of marketing and service research is rapidly changing as a result of advances in academic research and business practice. this has implications for our understanding of customer value. the purpose of this paper is to provide an update on customer value given today\\u2019s context (including recent advances such as technologies, human contact, collaborative consumption, service ecosystems and transformative service research); to revise holbrook\\u2019s value typology; and to propose a research agenda. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this paper uses a conceptual approach that is rooted in the service and marketing literature. findings: the contribution of this paper is threefold. first, this paper presents an evolved view on customer value which accounts for recent advances in academic research and business practice. second, this paper updates holbrook\\u2019s value typology by revising existing value types as well as identifying additional value types; and offers guidelines for measuring and modeling customer value. third, this paper proposes a research agenda to guide and stimulate future value research. originality\\u002fvalue: this paper provides an update on customer value, which is one of the most fundamental concepts in service and marketing research. this updated perspective has been approved and applauded by morris b. holbrook, one of the founding fathers of value research.\",\"integrated understanding of big data, big data analysis, and business intelligence: a case study of logistics. efficient decision making based on business intelligence (bi) is essential to ensure competitiveness for sustainable growth. the rapid development of information and communication technology has made collection and analysis of big data essential, resulting in a considerable increase in academic studies on big data and big data analysis (bda). however, many of these studies are not linked to bi, as companies do not understand and utilize the concepts in an integrated way. therefore, the purpose of this study is twofold. first, we review the literature on bi, big data, and bda to show that they are not separate methods but an integrated decision support system. second, we explore how businesses use big data and bda practically in conjunction with bi through a case study of sorting and logistics processing of a typical courier enterprise. we focus on the company's cost efficiency as regards to data collection, data analysis\\u002fsimulation, and the results from actual application. our findings may enable companies to achieve management efficiency by utilizing big data through efficient bi without investing in additional infrastructure. it could also give them indirect experience, thereby reducing trial and error in order to maintain or increase competitiveness.\",\"acceptance and use predictors of open data technologies: drawing upon the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology. policy-makers expect that open data will be accepted and used more and more, resulting in a range of benefits including transparency, participation and innovation. the ability to use open data partly depends on the availability of open data technologies. however, the actual use of open data technologies has shown mixed results, and there is a paucity of research on the predictors affecting the acceptance and use of open data technologies. a better understanding of these predictors can help policy-makers to determine which policy instruments they can use to increase the acceptance and use of open data technologies. a modified model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) is used to empirically determine predictors influencing the acceptance and use of open data technologies. the results show that the predictors performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and voluntariness of use together account for 45% of the variability in people's behavioral intention to use open data technologies. except for facilitating conditions, all these predictors significantly influence behavioral intention. our analysis of the predictors that influence the acceptance and use of open data technologies can be used to stimulate the use of open data technologies. the findings suggest that policy-makers should increase the acceptance and use of open data technologies by showing the benefits of open data use, by creating awareness of users that they already use open data, by developing social strategies to encourage people to stimulate each other to use open data, by integrating open data use in daily activities, and by decreasing the effort necessary to use open data technologies.\",\"beyond bitcoin: what blockchain and distributed ledger technologies mean for firms. blockchain technologies are benefiting from significant interest in both societal and business contexts. cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have grown rapidly in user adoption over the past 8 years. however, blockchain technologies, which fuel cryptocurrencies, have the potential to extend to other business applications even more profoundly. blockchain can be leveraged to drive innovation and increase efficiencies in new domains\\u2014including digital arts management, supply chains, and healthcare\\u2014but there remain technical, organizational, and regulatory headwinds that must be overcome before mass adoption can occur. in this article, we provide a brief history of blockchain and identify some of the key features that have enabled its popular uptake in the world of cryptocurrencies. we discuss how blockchain technologies have evolved from traditional software and web technologies and then examine their underlying strengths and evaluate new, noncryptocurrency use cases. we conclude with a look at the limitations of blockchain and present several important factors for managers considering blockchain implementation within their organizations.\",\"the impact of technology on creativity in design: an enhancement?. technology may be considered as an interface between individuals and the products they create, but we have to determine whether the use of new systems effectively enhance individuals\\u2019 creative activities. in this paper, we present a new angle of reflection that we illustrate in the field of creative design, since it is a constant challenge for designers to introduce creativity in the projects they work on. the approach we propose is centred on designers\\u2019 cognitive processes. we argue that both the development of new cad (computer-aided design) systems and their assessment should be conducted on the basis of a deep understanding of designers\\u2019 cognitive processes. in accordance with this view, we present three empirical studies that were conducted in order to analyse the impact of new design support systems on designers\\u2019 cognitive processes. therefore, the results we present contribute to further our knowledge of whether new cad technologies effectively facilitate designers\\u2019 activities and enhance their creativity.\",\"making sense of customer service experiences: a text mining review. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to systematically review the concepts and theories underlying customer service experience (cse) and its underlying five dimensions (physical, social, cognitive, affective and sensorial). in this research, the contribution of the sensorial dimension to cse research is emphasized. senses are especially important in forming perceptions within servicescapes that are typically rich in sensory stimuli. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this study systematically identifies 258 articles published between 1994 and 2018 in services and marketing journals. the analysis uses a text mining approach with the leximancer software to extract research concepts and their relationships. findings: the results demonstrate a shift from cse research focused on brands and products toward value and interaction, around three focal areas: service system architecture, with its value creation processes; servicescape, with an increasingly digital interaction interface and outcome measures, with a stronger focus on emotional and relational metrics. in cse research, the physical, social and cognitive dimensions are mostly researched in the focal areas of servicescape and outcome measures. although important in practice, the sensorial dimension is the least investigated cse dimension in service marketing research. text mining insights demonstrate rich opportunities for sensorial research, particularly in studies on servicescape. practical implications: the synthesis will inform managers and service providers which elements of cse are most relevant to customers when forming perceptions. these insights help service providers to control, manage and design (multi)-sensory stimuli that influence how customers will make sense of the servicescape. originality\\u002fvalue: this research is one of the first studies to examine the conceptual structure of cse with a text mining approach that systematically analyzes a large set of articles, therein reducing the potential for researchers\\u2019 interpretative bias. the paper provides an assessment of the role of the largely neglected but crucial sensorial dimension, and offers future research suggestions into this emerging topic.\",\"from direct marketing to interactive marketing: a retrospective review of the journal of research in interactive marketing. purpose: this study aims to present a retrospective of the journal of research in interactive marketing (jrim) on its 15th anniversary. the retrospective includes an analysis of jrim's growth in publication and citation, and an exploration of the journal's major themes and methodologies employed. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this study used a bibliometric methodology consisting of analytical techniques such as performance analysis, co-authorship network analysis, and bibliographic coupling to present a retrospective of jrim. findings: this study finds that jrim has grown consistently in terms of its publications and citations with its major themes being social media, advertising and communication, technology adoption, customer behavior, multi-channel marketing, viral marketing, and relationship marketing. this study also reveals that the journal's contributing authors tend to employ empirical and quantitative methodologies. originality\\u002fvalue: this is the first study to present a retrospective of jrim and one of the few that present a retrospective of interactive marketing. besides presenting the major themes, this study also analyzes the growth that such themes have undergone with time and what are the major themes in recent times in relation to the body of knowledge on interactive marketing curated through jrim.\",\"dedicated innovation systems to support the transformation towards sustainability: creating income opportunities and employment in the knowledge-based digital bioeconomy. in order to counter something to the most thrilling challenges of mankind at the beginning of the twenty-first century, production and consumption systems need to transform towards sustainability. we argue that the knowledge-based bioeconomy and digitalization are two promising technological approaches which require to be thought together in order to contribute to the transformation and to trigger the required technological dynamics. however, such a broad transformative process requires a participation of all societal stakeholders. innovation systems in principle offer a framework for policy designs supporting the transformation, but they need to be extended to include the direction towards overcoming the lock-in in oil-based economic activities and mass consumption. for this purpose, we introduce the idea of a dedicated innovation system, which takes care of potential inertia due to the interest of established (oil-based) industries and consider the economic opportunities raised by social and responsible innovation. the transformation process will likely compensate for decreasing jobs in traditional sectors, which are increasingly replaced by robotics and artificial intelligence. the knowledge-based digital bioeconomy is likely to generate the emergence of new sectors with new employment opportunities, e.g. in periphery regions or in the emerging sharing-economy sector.\",\"ai customer service: task complexity, problem-solving ability, and usage intention. artificial intelligence (ai) in the context of customer service, we define as a technology-enabled system for evaluating real-time service scenarios using data collected from digital and\\u002for physical sources in order to provide personalised recommendations, alternatives, and solutions to customers\\u2019 enquiries or problems, even very complex ones. we examined, in a banking services context, whether consumers preferred ai or human online customer service applications using an experimental design across three field-based experiments. the results show that, in the case of low-complexity tasks, consumers considered the problem-solving ability of ai to be greater than that of human customer service and were more likely to use ai while, conversely, for high-complexity tasks, they viewed human customer service as superior and were more likely to use it than ai. moreover, we found that perceived problem-solving ability mediated the effects of customers\\u2019 service usage intentions (i.e., their preference for ai vs. human) with task complexity serving as a boundary condition. here we discuss our research and the results and conclude by offering practical suggestions for banks seeking to reach customers and engage with them more effectively by leveraging the distinctive features of ai customer service.\",\"technology and entrepreneurial marketing decisions during covid-19. the prime concern of this study is to explore how technology influences entrepreneurial marketing decisions during the world pandemic (covid-19). the study uses a sample of 127 smes from bangladesh. data were collected by sending out questionnaires electronically and by mail. smart pls (sem) 3.0 was used to analyse the data following the quantitative method. the study reveals positive and significant relationships between entrepreneurial opportunity recognition, opportunity development and opportunity exploitation with their entrepreneurial marketing decisions. it also claims that entrepreneurial passion mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial opportunity recognition and opportunity development with their entrepreneurial marketing decisions. however, entrepreneurial passion does not mediate the relationship between entrepreneurial opportunity exploitation and entrepreneurial marketing decisions. the study offers researchers a broader and more wide-ranging view of the importance of artificial intelligence in small firms. researchers, educators and practitioners will benefit from the findings. the analyses are more complex and varied than the methodologies used in most of the limited previous research.\",\"a human-centric perspective exploring the readiness towards smart warehousing: the case of a large retail distribution warehouse. the explosive rise in technologies has revolutionised the way in which business operate, consumers buy, and the pace at which these activities take place. these advancements continue to have profound impact on business processes across the entire organisation. as such, logistics and supply chain management (lscm) are also leveraging benefits from digitisation, allowing organisations to increase efficiency and productivity, whilst also providing greater transparency and accuracy in the movement of goods. while the warehouse is a key component within lscm, warehousing research remains an understudied area within overall supply chain research, accounting for only a fraction of the overall research within this field. however, of the extant warehouse research, attention has largely been placed on warehouse design, performance and technology use, yet overlooking the determinants of artificial intelligence (ai) adoption within warehouses. accordingly, through proposing an extension of the technology\\u2013organisation\\u2013environment (toe) framework, this research explores the barriers and opportunities of ai within the warehouse of a major retailer. the findings for this qualitative study reveal ai challenges resulting from a shortage of both skill and mind-set of operational management, while also uncovering the opportunities presented through existing it infrastructure and pre-existing ai exposure of management.\",\"consumers\\u2019 willingness to adopt and use wechat wallet: an empirical study in south africa. for decades, the technology acceptance model (tam) has been validated by studies to discern its predictive power. however, scholars have noted that the assumptions in tam can incomprehensively address the demands of people in modern technologies. the current study, therefore, extends the capabilities of tam to predict the acceptance levels of the people-to-people (p2p) services of the wechat wallet in south africa. the findings show that, in addition to the constructs in tam, other pivotal factors that influence the behavior of south africans to adopt wechat wallet are trust, security, and privacy. using the structural equation modeling tool for analysis, we found that the proposed model explains acceptable variances in the predictors: 51%, 25%, and 21% in relative advantage or perceived usefulness as used in tam, privacy, and p2p, respectively, an evidence that may stimulate scholarly discussions in the future. these findings highlight that people in south africa may adopt and use the wechat wallet application if the proposed predictors are considered.\",\"from practice to theory and back to practice: reflexivity in measurement and evaluation for evidence-based policy making in the information society. this article presents a comprehensive review of literature and practice on the measurement and evaluation of ict impact in general and of selected public eservices (egovernment, ehealth, and einclusion), within the context of the information society paradigm. it calls for a sustained meta-level analysis, in which it is important to have a self-reflexive layer where we evaluate and measure how we evaluate and measure, and what the implications and the trade-offs are. the analysis justifies the call for reflexivity as a necessary step towards advancing our understanding of the impact of ict within the information society domains observed. the article concludes presenting some possible ways of re-coupling the conceptual and technical dimensions of the measurement process and linking the production of measurement data more closely with impact evaluation causal models and hypotheses. it suggests that this could be achieved by refocusing on the micro level and stimulating a gradual micro-macro link through an intermediate (meso) level, which effects need to be described using different measurements and evaluation paradigms. in order to do so it is required to refine and test our theories and models to find out where it would be most feasible to scale up to the global (macro) level and to shape and inform the production of more valid measurement indicators for better informing evidence-based policy making in the information society.\",\"programmatic creative: ai can think but it cannot feel. the authors conduct two studies to examine artificial intelligence (ai) in creative programmatic contexts. findings indicate that consumers have equally favorable attitudes toward human-created and al-created cognitive-oriented advertising, but form lower evaluations of al-created emotion-oriented creative content. programmatic creative ads are effective for rational appeals and utilitarian products, but are ineffective for emotional appeals and hedonic products. the studies indicate that human rather than ai input is needed for creating emotion-oriented advertisements.\",\"constituents and consequences of smart customer experience in retailing. smart retail technologies have the potential to improve the customer retail experience by providing superior and personalized retail services. however, when shoppers have to deal with technologically sophisticated retail services, concerns arise regarding the customers' adoption and their psychological reactions towards smart retail technologies. this study explores the factors which constitute customers' experience with the smart retail technologies and examines an innovative construct (i.e. smart customer experience) in retailing. the development of a conceptual model explores smart customer experiences and their consequences on smart technology, customer, and retailer-level outcomes. guided by technology adoption research, this research examines the relationships between smart customer experience, customer satisfaction, perceived risk, behavioral intentions, word-of-mouth intentions, stickiness to retail store, shopping effectiveness, and consumer well-being. this study uses a multi-phased research approach. findings indicate that smart customer experience directly enhances satisfaction and reduces perceived risk towards smart retail technologies. customer satisfaction increases behavioral intentions, word-of-mouth intentions, stickiness to retailer, shopping effectiveness, and customer well-being. perceived risk reduces behavioral intentions, word-of-mouth intentions, shopping effectiveness, and stickiness to retailer. finally, customer satisfaction and perceived risk both mediate the relationships between smart customer experience and outcome variables.\",\"a framework for evaluating and disclosing the esg related impacts of ai with the sdgs. artificial intelligence (ai) now permeates all aspects of modern society, and we are simultaneously seeing an increased focus on issues of sustainability in all human activities. all major corporations are now expected to account for their environmental and social footprint and to disclose and report on their activities. this is carried out through a diverse set of standards, frameworks, and metrics related to what is referred to as esg (environment, social, governance), which is now, increasingly often, replacing the older term csr (corporate social responsibility). the challenge addressed in this article is that none of these frameworks sufficiently capture the nature of the sustainability related impacts of ai. this creates a situation in which companies are not incentivised to properly analyse such impacts. simultaneously, it allows the companies that are aware of negative impacts to not disclose them. this article proposes a framework for evaluating and disclosing esg related ai impacts based on the united nation\\u2019s sustainable development goals (sdg). the core of the framework is here presented, with examples of how it forces an examination of micro, meso, and macro level impacts, a consideration of both negative and positive impacts, and account-ing for ripple effects and interlinkages between the different impacts. such a framework helps make analyses of ai related esg impacts more structured and systematic, more transparent, and it allows companies to draw on research in ai ethics in such evaluations. in the closing section, microsoft\\u2019s sustainability reporting from 2018 and 2019 is used as an example of how sustainability reporting is currently carried out, and how it might be improved by using the approach here advocated.\",\"when ai-based services fail: examining the effect of the self-ai connection on willingness to share negative word-of-mouth after service failures [\\u5f53\\u57fa\\u4e8e\\u4eba\\u5de5\\u667a\\u80fd\\u7684\\u670d\\u52a1\\u5931\\u8d25\\u65f6\\uff1a\\u68c0\\u67e5\\u81ea\\u6211\\u6982\\u5ff5-\\u4eba\\u5de5\\u667a\\u80fd\\u8054\\u7ed3\\u5bf9\\u670d\\u52a1\\u5931\\u8d25\\u540e\\u5206\\u4eab\\u8d1f\\u9762\\u53e3\\u7891\\u7684\\u610f\\u613f\\u7684\\u5f71\\u54cd]. recent proliferation of artificial intelligence (ai) in service encounters gives rise to questions on how consumers respond to these novel technologies. this study seeks to examine the influence of ai service failures on consumers\\u2019 propensity to share negative word-of-mouth. three experiments demonstrate that consumers are less willing to share negative word-of-mouth after a service failure caused by an ai recommendation system, in contrast to a human employee, despite there being no difference in the failure, firm blame, or dissatisfaction with the failure. further investigation suggests that this effect is driven by consumers\\u2019 perceived connection with the ai that uses their past behavior to predict their future preferences. the conclusions shed light on the overall understanding of consumer-ai interactions. the results also provide managerial implications for firms to implement ai effectively and carefully in their service offerings.\",\"artificial intelligence in supply chain management: a systematic literature review. this paper seeks to identify the contributions of artificial intelligence (ai) to supply chain management (scm) through a systematic review of the existing literature. to address the current scientific gap of ai in scm, this study aimed to determine the current and potential ai techniques that can enhance both the study and practice of scm. gaps in the literature that need to be addressed through scientific research were also identified. more specifically, the following four aspects were covered: (1) the most prevalent ai techniques in scm; (2) the potential ai techniques for employment in scm; (3) the current ai-improved scm subfields; and (4) the subfields that have high potential to be enhanced by ai. a specific set of inclusion and exclusion criteria are used to identify and examine papers from four scm fields: logistics, marketing, supply chain and production. this paper provides insights through systematic analysis and synthesis.\",\"applications of big data in emerging management disciplines: a literature review using text mining. the importance of data-driven decisions and support is increasing day by day in every management area. the constant access to volume, variety, and veracity of data has made big data an integral part of management studies. new sub-management areas are emerging day by day with the support of big data to drive businesses. this study takes a systematic literature review approach to uncover the emerging management areas supported by big data in contemporary times. for this, we have analyzed the research papers published in the reputed management journals in the last ten years, fir using network analysis followed by natural language processing summarization techniques to find the emerging new management areas which are yet to get much attention. furthermore, we ran the same exercise in each of these management areas to uncover these areas better. this research will act as a reference for future information systems (is) scholars who want to perform analysis that is deep-dive in nature on each of these management areas, which in the coming times will get all the due attention to become dedicated research domains in the management area. we finally conclude the study by identifying the scope of future research in each of these management areas, which will be a true value addition for is researchers.\",\"artificial intelligence in marketing: topic modeling, scientometric analysis, and research agenda. the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (ai) offers exciting opportunities for marketing practice and academic research. in this study, through the application of natural language processing, machine learning, and statistical algorithms, we examine extant literature in terms of its dominant topics, diversity, evolution over time, and dynamics to map the existing knowledge base. ten salient research themes emerge: (1) understanding consumer sentiments, (2) industrial opportunities of ai, (3) analyzing customer satisfaction, (4) electronic word-of-mouth\\u2013based insights, (5) improving market performance, (6) using ai for brand management, (7) measuring and enhancing customer loyalty and trust, (8) ai and novel services, (9) using ai to improve customer relationships, and (10) ai and strategic marketing. the scientometric analyses reveal key concepts, keyword co-occurrences, authorship networks, top research themes, landmark publications, and the evolution of the research field over time. with the insights as a foundation, this article closes with a proposed agenda for further research.\",\"development of data-driven technology roadmap considering dependency: an arm-based technology roadmapping. the active incorporation of business data has become a vital process in the recent business environment. despite the potential utility of massive database, technology roadmap, a well-known strategic planning method, still remains a subjective and qualitative method conducted by some experts. even if some studies have tried, previous research lacks a dependency measure that can be used between layers, which is a critical part of technology roadmaps. this paper therefore suggests an association rule mining (arm)-based technology roadmap to identify the relationship between different layers. the use of arm fits the purpose, in terms of capturing the dependency information. two types of roadmap are developed: a keyword portfolio map and a keyword relational map. in the keyword portfolio map, four types of keyword pairs are identified according to their support and confidence. in the keyword relational map, a 2-dimensional map is developed using support as an intra-layer affinity relationship and confidence as an inter-layer dependency relationship.\",\"an initial model of trust in chatbots for customer service - findings from a questionnaire study. chatbots are predicted to play a key role in customer service. users' trust in such chatbots is critical for their uptake. however, there is a lack of knowledge concerning users' trust in chatbots. to bridge this knowledge gap, we present a questionnaire study (n = 154) that investigated factors of relevance for trust in customer service chatbots. the study included two parts: an explanatory investigation of the relative importance of factors known to predict trust from the general literature on interactive systems and an exploratory identification of other factors of particular relevance for trust in chatbots. the participants were recruited as part of their dialogue with one of four chatbots for customer service. based on the findings, we propose an initial model of trust in chatbots for customer service, including chatbot-related factors (perceived expertise and responsiveness), environment-related factors (risk and brand perceptions) and user-related factors (propensity to trust technology). research highlights: we extend the current knowledge base on natural language interfaces by investigating factors affecting users' trust in chatbots for customer service. chatbot-related factors, specifically perceived expertise and responsiveness, are found particularly important to users' trust in such chatbots, but also environment-related factors such as brand perception and user-related factors such as propensity to trust technology. on the basis of the findings, we propose an initial model of users' trust chatbots for customer service.\",\"covid-19 and the digital transformation of education: what are we learning on 4ir in south africa?. the study sought to assess the influence of the covid-19 pandemic in motivating digital transformation in the education sector in south africa. the study was premised on the fact that learning in south africa and the rest of the world came to a standstill due to the lockdown necessitated by covid-19. to assess the impact, the study tracked the rate at which the fourth industrial revolution (4ir) tools were used by various institutions during the covid-19 lockdown. data were obtained from secondary sources. the findings are that, in south africa, during the lockdown, a variety of 4ir tools were unleashed from primary education to higher and tertiary education where educational activities switched to remote (online) learning. these observations reflect that south africa generally has some pockets of excellence to drive the education sector into the 4ir, which has the potential to increase access. access to education, particularly at a higher education level, has always been a challenge due to a limited number of spaces available. much as this pandemic has brought with it massive human suffering across the globe, it has presented an opportunity to assess successes and failures of deployed technologies, costs associated with them, and scaling these technologies to improve access.\",\"analyzing the mediating role of organizational ambidexterity and digital business transformation on industry 4.0 capabilities and sustainable supply chain performance. purpose: despite the growing awareness of supply chains on industry 4.0 (i4.0) capabilities as the enabler of sustainable performance, little is known about what accelerates this interaction. prior studies have focused on the ambidexterity dilemma and the need to adopt sustainable inter-organizational governance to drive i4.0 capabilities while achieving sustainable performance. to address these issues, this paper aims to explore the distinct and combined effects of several approaches such as digital business transformation (dbt), organizational ambidexterity (oa) and circular business models (cbms) on the relationship between i4.0 capabilities and sustainable performance. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: drawing upon a hybrid methodology including structural equation modeling and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, this paper develops and tests a hypothetical model using data collected from 306 organizations in europe, asia and africa. findings: the study findings lead to several important implications concerning the potential paths linking i4.0 and sustainable performance. notably, the dbt was found to mediate this relationship by integrating circular principles to devise business models. moreover, oa was found to substitute the cbms in developing new sustainable business models and reconcile sustainability. originality\\u002fvalue: the study is among the first to analyze the combined effects of oa, dbt and cbms on the relationship between i4.0 capabilities and sustainable performance at the supply chain level. moreover, the findings propose several solutions to resolve the sustainability dilemma through i4.0 capabilities, dbt, oa and cbms.\",\"factors affecting the use of facial-recognition payment: an example of chinese consumers. the emergence and use of facial-recognition payment technology has brought new challenges. although credit-card payment is quick and easy, it is easy to lose a card or forget the password. because people use simple passwords and reuse them on different accounts and services, passwords can be shared and cracked. qr payment is inseparable from smart phones, smart phones may be lost, signals may be unstable, and batteries may be exhausted. however, facial-recognition technology, which detects and describes feature vectors without physical contact, directly contributes to overall efficiency, performance, and accuracy. currently, studies of technical issues of facial-recognition technology and facial-recognition payment systems are very popular. there are many studies that emphasize the working principle of the facial-recognition system, the system's reliability, and the future development trend. however, for non-technical issues, such as from the perspective of consumers, research on the characteristics of facial-recognition payment and the factors affecting consumer's intent to use is rare. therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the factors influencing consumers' willingness to use facial-recognition payment systems. this study has selected security, visibility, and expected effort and social image as the feature variables of the facial-recognition payment system. results in this paper shows that the safety, security, visibility and social image will affect consumers' intent to use the system. it can also influence consumers' intent to use through perceived usefulness. the amount of effort expected not only has direct influence on intent to use but also influences the intent to use by the mediating factor of perceived usefulness. in this article, openness characteristic (consumer's personality) has a moderating effect on the relationship between security, expected effort and usage intention.\",\"the digital frontier: envisioning future technologies impact on the classroom. global advances in technology and information are purportedly propelling transformations and disruptions across many sectors, including education. however, historical reviews of technology integration in education mainly reveal weak or ineffectual impacts on learning, and only minor reforms to date within the education system. this study adopted a futures studies methodological approach to explore how k-12 educational spaces and experiences might be shaped by emerging and emergent technologies. in this regard, a series of vignettes are presented which critically examine the potential of augmented reality technologies, artificial intelligence, and smart materials technologies to transform future learning experiences and learning environments across k-12 education contexts, while also challenging assumptions about, and considering influences on, these futures. the focus of the study was not to predict a single or desired future for education, but rather to critically consider a range of possible education futures informed by the articulation of these three vignettes. the paper concludes with discourse on an emergent pedagogic approach that has the potential to prepare teachers and learners to interact and flourish within radically re-configured learning spaces that lean on the aforementioned technologies to support transitions within and beyond the school and its connected communities.\",\"big data and analytics in hospitality and tourism: a systematic literature review. purpose: the purpose of this work is to survey the body of research revolving around big data (bd) and analytics in hospitality and tourism, by detecting macro topical areas, research streams and gaps and to develop an agenda for future research. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this research is based on a systematic literature review of academic papers indexed in the scopus and web of science databases published up to 31 december 2020. the outputs were analyzed using bibliometric techniques, network analysis and topic modeling. findings: the number of scientific outputs in research with hospitality and tourism settings has been expanding over the period 2015\\u20132020, with a substantial stability of the areas examined. the vast majority are published in academic journals where the main reference area is neither hospitality nor tourism. the body of research is rather fragmented and studies on relevant aspects, such as bd analytics capabilities, are virtually missing. most of the outputs are empirical. moreover, many of the articles collected relatively small quantities of records and, regardless of the time period considered, only a handful of articles mix a number of different techniques. originality\\u002fvalue: this work sheds new light on the emergence of a body of research at the intersection of hospitality and tourism management and data science. it enriches and complements extant literature reviews on bd and analytics, combining these two interconnected topics.\",\"the productivity j-curve: how intangibles complement general purpose technologies\\u2020. general purpose technologies gpts like ai enable and require significant complementary investments. these investments are often intangible and poorly measured in national accounts. we develop a model that shows how this can lead to underestimation of productivity growth in a new gpts early years and, later, when the benefits of intangible investments are harvested, productivity growth overestimation. we call this phenomenon the productivity j-curve. we apply our method to us data and find that adjusting for intangibles related to computer hardware and software yields a tfp level that is 15.9 percent higher than official measures by the end of 2017.

autonomous customer service agents (chatbots). implementing a field experiment in collaboration with a dual channel clothing retailer based in the united states, we automate a used clothing buy-back process, such that individuals engage with the retailer's autonomous chatbot to describe the used clothes they wish to sell, obtain a cash offer, and (if they accept the offer) print a shipping label to finalize the transaction. we causally estimate the impact of chatbot anthropomorphism on transaction conversion by randomly exposing consumers to exogenously varied levels of chatbot anthropomorphism, operationalized by incorporating a random draw from a set of three anthropomorphic features: humor, communication delays, and social presence. we provide evidence that, in this retail setting, anthropomorphism is beneficial for transaction outcomes, but that it also leads to significant increases in offer sensitivity. we argue that the latter effect occurs because, as a chatbot becomes more human-like, consumers shift to a fairness evaluation or negotiating mindset. we also provide descriptive evidence suggesting that the benefits of anthropomorphism for transaction conversion may derive, at least in part, from consumers' increased willingness to disclose personal information necessary to complete the transaction. copyright:\",\"does ict generate economic growth? a meta-regression analysis. despite phenomenal technological progress and exponential growth in computing power, economic growth remains comparative sluggish. in this paper, we investigate two core issues: (1) is there really no connection between ict and national economic growth? and (2) what factors moderate the ict\\u2013growth relationship? we apply meta-regression analysis to 466 estimates drawn from 59 econometric studies that explore the solow or productivity paradox that there is little impact of ict on economic growth and productivity. we explore the differential impact of ict on developed and developing countries and the differential impact of different types of ict: landlines, cell phones, computer technology and internet access. after accommodating potential econometric misspecification bias and publication selection bias, we detect evidence that ict has indeed contributed positively to economic growth, at least on average. both developed and developing countries benefit from landline and cell technologies, with cell technologies\\u2019 growth effect approximately twice as strong as landlines. however, developed countries gain significantly more from computing than do developing countries. in contrast, we find little evidence that the internet has had a positive impact on growth.\",\"the use of gamification in education: a bibliometric and text mining analysis. the use of games in education represents a promising tool to motivate and engage students in their learning process. most of previous research on the topic has focused to develop theoretical frameworks or to conduct experiments as a means to analyse learning outcomes such as knowledge retention, problem-solving skills gains or attitudes toward game-based learning. nevertheless, little research has focused on providing a comprehensive literature review, which will help researchers to better understand how this stream of research has evolved over the last years. in this study, we use a bibliometric, social network and text mining analysis in order to provide useful up-to-date information to picture the state of the art about current research and evolution of the topic. analysis on a sample of 139 articles published in top journals over the last 5 years (2010\\u20132014) allowed identifying relevant authors and institutions, key constructs and themes involved, and trends of knowledge development. main findings suggest an increasing academic interest on the topic over the last 5 years and a wide variety of constructs that were clustered in four main themes that we named: (i) effectiveness, (ii) acceptance, (iii) engagement and (iv) social interactions. future research lines are also addressed. lay description: what is currently known about the use of games in education: games can increase students' intrinsic motivation to learn. games support active learning. games facilitate scaffolded instruction based on each individual student's needs. what this paper adds to this: this study identifies the most relevant researchers in this research area. this study identifies the most relevant institutions involved in this research area. this study identifies the main topics and themes researched by researchers. this study identifies the main methodological approach used by researchers. findings for practitioners: relevant researchers and institutions to

for artificial intelligence education. over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning techniques have shown the potential of ai-driven and data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in k-12 computing education, too. as machine learning enters k-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. but as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in k-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. despite the central position of machine learning and ai in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. this is especially true of the k-12 curriculum space. this article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in k-12 education. the article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that k-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. the article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader k-12 computing curricula. a crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based 'traditional' programming is a central aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking.\",\"digital transformation and entrepreneurship process in smes of india: a moderating role of adoption of ai-crm capability and strategic planning. purpose: the purpose of this study is to identify the determinants that could impact corporate digital entrepreneurship for the small and medium enterprises (smes) of india. the study also investigates the moderating role that adopting artificial intelligence (ai)-customer relationship management (crm) capability and strategic planning has in corporate digital entrepreneurship. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: with the inputs from literature and theories, a model has been developed conceptually. the model has been validated by partial least squares structural equation modeling technique with consideration of 315 usable respondents. the effects of the moderators have also been investigated by multigroup analysis. findings: the study highlights that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and willingness to change significantly impact corporate digital entrepreneurship for the smes of india. the study also highlights that the two moderators have significant impacts on the relationships between corporate digital entrepreneurship and its predictors. research limitations\\u002fimplications: this study has developed a unique model, which provides effective inputs to the entrepreneurs of smes of emerging economies. these inputs will help entrepreneurs to frame their policies to improve the existing traditional practices and processes that could be transformed into more digitalization for improving efficiency of their corporate digital entrepreneurial activities. originality\\u002fvalue: there are no studies which investigated how perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and willingness to change could impact corporate digital entrepreneurship with the moderating effects of adoption of ai-crm capability and strategic planning, as concerns smes of emerging economies. in this regard, this study is deemed to be a unique attempt.\",\"close encounters of the ai kind: use of ai influencers as brand endorsers. brand endorsers can contribute to a brand\\u2019s success or failure (in the case of endorser transgressions). recent advancements in technology have produced new, nonhuman alternatives to traditional celebrity endorsers. these new endorsers rely on artificial intelligence (ai) to interact with and influence consumers. two studies demonstrate that ai influencers can produce positive brand benefits similar to those produced by human celebrity endorsers. moreover, just like their human counterparts, ai influencers can also commit transgressions that result in degradation of the endorsed brand. importantly, though, ai influencers differ from human celebrity endorsers in that consumers are less likely to view them as unique entities (as tested in a pilot study). thus, consumers are more likely to perceive a transgression committed by an ai influencer as behavior applicable to all ai influencers, but they are less likely to view celebrity endorser behaviors as interchangeable. as such, after an ai influencer has committed a transgression, replacing the ai influencer with a celebrity endorser attenuates negative brand perceptions, an effect which cannot be realized if the replacement is another ai influencer.\",\"how artificial intelligence technology affects productivity and employment: firm-level evidence from taiwan. the effects of the rapid development of artificial intelligence (ai), a general-purpose technology, on firm performance is an emerging and crucial issue. this study examines the impact of ai technology on firms\\u2019 productivity and employee profiles. we use the keyword-matching method to parse the text of taiwan patent grants, and obtain matched firm-level data on ai innovations in taiwan's electronics industry for the 2002\\u20132018 period. empirical estimations indicate that ai technology is positively associated with productivity and employment. meanwhile, non-ai patents also generate pro-productivity and pro-employment effects with a magnitude similar to that of ai technology. inventing ai technologies crucially alters firms\\u2019 workforce compositions, which reduce the share of labor force with educational qualifications of college level and below. robustness checks reaffirm these findings.\",\"a systematic review of ai technology-based service encounters: implications for hospitality and tourism operations. the hospitality and tourism industry faces serious challenges during public health emergencies such as covid-19. managers are concerned not only about how to maintain business and provide humanized services but also about social distancing. this study presented artificial intelligence (ai) technology-based service encounters as a possible solution and examined the antecedents and consequences of the encounter triad including customers, employees, and ai. based on a systematic literature review, the study identified 4 modes of ai technology-based service encounters: ai-supplemented, ai-generated, ai-mediated, and ai-facilitated encounters. in addition, the study developed an integrated model to specify the factors that influence ai technology-infused service encounters in general and the customer service outcomes that result from the encounters. the findings contribute to service management and ai application

key facilitators and inhibitors of fitness wearable technology (fwt) adoption and the intention to recommend this technology. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: an innovative and integrated research model was developed by combining constructs from two well-established theoretical models, the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut2) and diffusion of innovation (doi). the proposed research model was empirically validated using data collected from 392 respondents in china. the data was analyzed using the partial least squares method, a statistical analysis technique based on structural equation modeling. findings: the results indicate that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, habit, compatibility and innovativeness have significant direct and indirect effects on fwt adoption and the intention to recommend it. the significance of people\\u2019s intention to recommend fwt to others in social networking sites (e.g. facebook, weibo, and wechat) is also confirmed. practical implications: the findings may facilitate the design and implementation of fwt products, applications and functionalities that can achieve

management for enhancing supply chain agility: a deep-learning-based dual-stage pls-sem-ann analysis. this study posits that the use of artificial intelligence (ai) enables supply chains (scs) to dynamically react to volatile environments, and alleviate potentially costly decision-makings for small-medium enterprises (smes). building on a resource-based view, this work examines the impact of ai on sc risk management for smes. a structural model comprising of ai-risk management capabilities, sc re-engineering capabilities and supply chain agility (sca) was developed and tested based on data collected from executives, managers and senior managers of smes the main methodological approach used in this study is partial least squares-based structural equation modelling (pls-sem) and artificial neural network (ann). the results identified the use of ai for risk management influences sc re-engineering capabilities and agility. re-engineering capabilities further affect and mediate agility. pls-sem and ann were compared and the results revealed consistency for models a and b. current levels of demand uncertainties in the sc challenges managers in making complex trade-off decisions that require huge management resources in very limited time. with ai, it is possible to model various scenarios to answer crucial questions that archaic infrastructures are not able to. this study combines a multi-construct agility concept and identified non-linear relationships in the model.\",\"co-evolution and emergence in design. the notion of co-evolution has been widely adopted as a

detection of patent vacuums, defined as unexplored areas of new technologies, deserves intensive research. however, previous studies for identifying patent vacuums on the patent map have been subjected to some limitations, stemming from the subjective and manual identification of patent vacuums. to address these limitations, this paper proposes a generative topographic mapping (gtm)-based patent map, which aims to automatically identify a patent vacuum. since gtm is a probabilistic approach of mapping multidimensional data space onto a low-dimensional latent space and vice versa, it contributes to the automatic detection and interpretation of patent vacuums. the proposed approach consists of three stages. firstly, text mining is executed in order to transform patent documents into keyword vectors as structured data. secondly, the gtm is employed to develop the patent map, subsequently leading to the discovery of patent vacuums, which are expressed as blank areas in the map. lastly, the meaning of each patent vacuum is interpreted by the inverse mapping of patent vacuums onto the original keyword vector. the case study is conducted with lithography technology-related patents. we believe the proposed approach not only saves time and effort for identifying patent vacuums, but also increases objectivity and reliability.\",\"\\u201cbaby, you can drive my car\\u201d: psychological antecedents that drive consumers\\u2019 adoption of ai-powered autonomous vehicles. artificial intelligence (ai)-powered autonomous vehicles (avs) are one of the most highly anticipated technological advancements of our time, with potentially wide-ranging social implications in terms of driver\\u002fpassenger safety, equity and environmental aspects. however, most consumers feel reluctant towards the adoption of ai-powered avs. to analyse user acceptance of ai-powered avs, we need to understand the related psychological, social and cognitive factors. to do so, we established a conceptual model based on the technology acceptance literature and considered how performance and effort expectancy, social recognition, hedonism technology security and privacy concerns influence both technology trust and user well-being as mediators that subsequently influence the behavioural intention of the use of ai-powered avs. we used user innovativeness as a moderator, and we performed a survey in france. our results from the structural equation modelling largely support the positive relationship between the behavioural intention to use ai-powered avs and performance-\\u002feffort expectancy, social recognition, well-being, hedonism and technology trust, as well as security. on the other hand, privacy concerns negatively influence technology trust.\",\"is blockchain able to enhance environmental sustainability? a systematic review and research agenda from the perspective of sustainable development goals (sdgs). blockchain is a disruptive technology that is revolutionizing information technology and represents a change of cultural paradigm for the way in which information is shared. companies are rushing to understand how they can use blockchain distributed ledger technology to innovate processes, products and transactions. in a globalized world where environmental sustainability is a critical success factor, what is the role of the blockchain? by using a systematic review approach and the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses (prisma) protocol, this study attempts to identify whether and how blockchain technology is considered able to affect environmental sustainability. findings from 195 studies from 2015 to 2020 were analysed after the search protocol was applied. the results indicate that blockchain technology could contribute to environmentally sustainable development goals (sdgs) from different points of view, such as supporting the realization of a sustainable supply chain, improving energy efficiency and promoting the creation of secure and reliable smart cities. furthermore, the investigation highlights the sectors where to focus research investments, providing a way to reward sustainable behaviour and increasing environmental sustainability. on the other hand, blockchain has no negligible negative effects on the environment that need to be considered before adoption.\",\"artificial intelligence in online higher education: a systematic review of empirical research from 2011 to 2020. as online learning has been widely adopted in higher education in recent years, artificial intelligence (ai) has brought new ways for improving instruction and learning in online higher education. however, there is a lack of literature reviews that focuses on the functions, effects, and implications of applying ai in the online higher education context. in addition, what ai algorithms are commonly used and how they influence online higher education remain unclear. to fill these gaps, this systematic review provides an overview of empirical research on the applications of ai in online higher education. specifically, this literature review examines the functions of ai in empirical researches, the algorithms used in empirical researches and the effects and implications generated by empirical research. according to the screening criteria, out of the 434 initially identified articles for the period between 2011 and 2020, 32 articles are included for the final synthesis. results find that: (1) the functions of ai applications in online higher education include prediction of learning status, performance or satisfaction, resource recommendation, automatic assessment, and improvement of learning experience; (2) traditional ai technologies are commonly adopted while more advanced techniques (e.g., genetic algorithm, deep learning) are rarely used yet; and (3) effects generated by ai applications include a high quality of ai-enabled prediction with multiple input variables, a high quality of ai-enabled recommendations based on student characteristics, an improvement of students\\u2019 academic performance, and an improvement of online engagement and participation. this systematic review proposes the following theoretical, technological, and practical implications: (1) the integration of educational and learning theories into ai-enabled online learning; (2) the adoption of advanced ai technologies to collect and analyze real-time process data; and (3) the implementation of more empirical research to test actual effects of ai applications in online higher education.\",\"research trends on big data in marketing: a text mining and topic modeling based literature analysis. given the research interest on big data in marketing, we present a research literature analysis based on a text mining semi-automated approach with the goal of identifying the main trends in this domain. in particular, the analysis focuses on relevant terms and topics related with five dimensions: big data, marketing, geographic location of authors\\u2019 affiliation (countries and continents), products, and sectors. a total of 1560 articles published from 2010 to 2015 were scrutinized. the findings revealed that research is bipartite between technological and research domains, with big data publications not clearly aligning cutting edge techniques toward marketing benefits. also, few inter-continental co-authored publications were found. moreover, findings show that research in big data applications to marketing is still in an embryonic stage, thus making it essential to develop more direct efforts toward business for big data to thrive in the marketing arena.\",\"covid-19 and digital disruption in uk universities: afflictions and affordances of emergency online migration. covid-19 has caused the closure of university campuses around the world and migration of all learning, teaching, and assessment into online domains. the impacts of this on the academic community as frontline providers of higher education are profound. in this article, we report the findings from a survey of n = 1148 academics working in universities in the united kingdom (uk) and representing all the major disciplines and career hierarchy. respondents report an abundance of what we call \\u2018afflictions\\u2019 exacted upon their role as educators and in far fewer yet no less visible ways \\u2018affordances\\u2019 derived from their rapid transition to online provision and early \\u2018entry-level\\u2019 use of digital pedagogies. overall, they suggest that online migration is engendering significant dysfunctionality and disturbance to their pedagogical roles and their personal lives. they also signpost online migration as a major challenge for student recruitment, market sustainability, an academic labour-market, and local economies.\",\"collaborative problem-solution co-evolution in creative design. creative design concepts are often viewed as developing iteratively, with the design problem and solutions 'co-evolving' in a mutually adaptive manner. we report a study examining whether the co-evolution concept captures the creativity arising in collaborative, team-based design practice. the analysis revealed that co-evolution episodes occurred regularly and embodied various directional transitions between problem and solution spaces. moreover, the team leader often initiated this co-evolution. co-evolution episodes linked with other creative activities such as analogising and mental simulation and there was a clear association between co-evolution and expressions of epistemic uncertainty, suggesting that designers were dealing with considerable complexity and ambiguity. our findings support the view that co-evolution is the 'engine' of creativity in collaborative design.\",\"the effect of manufacturing intelligence on green innovation performance in china. accelerating the intelligent transformation of manufacturing industry is an important strategic choice to realize the green innovation transformation. based on the perspectives of static efficiency and dynamic productivity, this paper analyzes the effect of manufacturing intelligence on green innovation performance and its internal mechanism from theoretical and empirical levels by using the dynamic spatial lag model (dsar), mediating effect model and moderating effect model. the results show that: in the whole country, manufacturing intelligence has a significant promotion effect on green innovation performance; the reason why manufacturing intelligence can promote the improvement of green innovation performance is that manufacturing intelligence is conducive to the production of \\\"technology promotion effect\\\" and \\\"cost reduction effect\\\", so as to promote green technology innovation, then effectively increase the desirable outputs and significantly decrease the undesirable outputs; the effect of manufacturing intelligence on green innovation performance has obvious regional heterogeneity: the improvement effect of manufacturing intelligence on green innovation performance in the eastern region is significantly higher than that in the central and western regions. in addition, further analysis shows that green technological progress rather than green technical efficiency is the main driving force for manufacturing intelligence to improve the dynamic green innovation performance.\",\"\\u201cso what if chatgpt wrote it?\\u201d multidisciplinary perspectives on opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational ai for research, practice and policy. transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as chatgpt, designed to generate sophisticated text indistinguishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. the technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. the contributors acknowledge chatgpt's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. however, opinion is split on whether chatgpt's use should be restricted or legislated. drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. the avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative ai; examining biases of generative ai attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative ai implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative ai for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative ai; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative ai across different contexts.\",\"towards a holistic analysis of mobile payments: a multiple perspectives approach. as mobile technologies and services are in constant evolution, many speculate on whether or not mobile payments will be a killer application for mobile commerce. to have a better understanding of the market, there is a need to analyze not only the technology but also the different actors that are involved. for this purpose, we propose to conduct two disruption analyses to draw the disruptiveness profile of mobile payment solutions compared to other payment instruments. then, we try to discover what factors have hindered the technical and commercial development by using a dss based on a multi-criteria decision making method called electre i.\",\"exploring the influence of big data analytics management capabilities on sustainable tourism supply chain performance: the moderating role of technology orientation. the current study examines the importance of big data analytics (bda) management capabilities, namely bda planning, bda investment, bda coordination, and bda control on sustainable tourism supply chain performance (stscp). the study also explored the moderating role of technology orientation on bda management capabilities' association with stscp. perceptual responses from 212 analytics professionals suggest bda planning, bda coordination, and bda control as prominent enablers of sustainable tourism supply chain performance. furthermore, technology orientation was found to enhance the contribution of bda planning, bda coordination, and bda control as enablers.\",\"working and organizing in the age of the learning algorithm. learning algorithms, technologies that generate responses, classifications, or dynamic predictions that resemble those of a knowledge worker, raise important research questions for organizational scholars related to work and organizing. we suggest that such algorithms are distinguished by four consequential aspects: black-boxed performance, comprehensive digitization, anticipatory quantification, and hidden politics. these aspects are likely to alter work and organizing in qualitatively different ways beyond simply signaling an acceleration of long-term technology trends. our analysis indicates that learning algorithms will transform expertise in organizations, reshape work and occupational boundaries, and offer novel forms of coordination and control. thus, learning algorithms can be considered performative due to the extent to which their use can shape and alter work and organizational realities. their rapid deployment requires scholarly attention to societal issues such as the extent to which the algorithm is authorized to make decisions, the need to incorporate morality in the technology, and their digital iron-cage potential.\",\"factors influencing the adoption of mobile commerce applications in cameroon. as smartphone penetration continues to double in sub-saharan africa, many businesses are looking into this channel for conducting their business activities. in cameroon, all the top e-commerce giants have deployed smartphone applications to facilitate m-commerce activities. however, little is known about the factors that influence m-commerce adoption in the country. as such, this study had as objective to determine the key factors that influence consumer's adoption of m-commerce applications in cameroon. using data from 372 respondents, a modified version of the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut2) was validated in the cameroon context. the findings showed that social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivations, perceived risk and perceived trust were significant predictors of the behavioural intention to adopt m-commerce applications. also, the results showed that consumers who had a high intention to adopt m-commerce were more likely to recommend the technology to others. for researchers, the study depicts the relevance of extending existing technology acceptance models like the utuat2 with appropriate factors in different technological and geographical context. for practitioners, the study identifies customer-specific and environmental factors that m-commerce providers in cameroon and other regions with similar characteristics could consider when designing and implementing strategies for attracting consumers to use their m-commerce applications.\",\"nft marketing: how marketers can use nonfungible tokens in their campaigns. nonfungible tokens (nfts) are a record of ownership of primarily digital media, where the nft is stored on a blockchain. according to the 2021 gartner hype cycle for key technologies, nfts may significantly transform marketing functions. marketing managers wishing to adopt nfts therefore need to know something about the marketing implications. this article explains nfts in broad terms and discusses the marketing implications using a modified aida hierarchy. these implications can give marketing managers and executives guidelines on how to persuade consumers to purchase nfts owing to their unique characteristics, such as scarcity, nonfungibility, proven authenticity, proof of ownership, royalties, and direct distribution infrastructure.\",\"blockchain technology for smart city and smart tourism: latest trends and challenges. blockchain is one of the latest network-based technologies, which will have significant impact on most industries including tourism. even though blockchain technology is at the infancy stage of development, tools such as cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and decentralised applications have begun to influence tourism transactions. this paper makes an attempt to highlight the key characteristics of blockchain technology in conjunction with the smart city\\u002ftourism framework while making propositions of how the technology would evolve and influence the industry. major issues related to the technology as well as challenges are also discussed, including some misconceptions.\",\"group pooling for deep tourism demand forecasting. advances in tourism demand forecasting immensely benefit tourism and other sectors, such as economic and resource management studies. however, even for novel ai-based methodologies, the challenge of limited available data causing model overfitting and high complexity in forecasting models remains a major problem. this study proposes a novel group-pooling-based deep-learning model (gp\\u2013dlm) to address these problems and improve model accuracy. specifically, with our group-pooling method, we advance the tourism forecasting literature with the following findings. first, gp\\u2013dlm provides superior accuracy in comparison with benchmark models. second, we define the novel dynamic time warping (dtw) clustering quantitative approach. third, we reveal cross-region factors that influence travel demands of the studied regions, including \\u201ctravel blog,\\u201d \\u201cbest food,\\u201d and

simultaneously promoting environmental protection and economic development. this study examines the determinants of sustainable green technology invention in china, with a focus on the differences in green technology development priorities in each five-year plan period. this study uses patent publication data in a patent decomposition analysis framework. we find that sustainable green patent publications increased due to efficiency improvements, the prioritization of sustainable green patents, an increased r&d expenditure share and economic growth, especially during periods of gradual economic development in china. additionally, we find that the relative priority of r&d shifted from renewable energy technology to pollution abatement and other sustainable green technology in the 12th five-year plan. the different r&d priority trends for sustainable green technologies among the five-year plans can be used to formulate effective policies that promote sustainable green technology invention.\",\"on the convergence of artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology: a scoping review and future research agenda. developments in artificial intelligence (ai) and distributed ledger technology (dlt) currently lead to lively debates in academia and practice. ai processes data to perform tasks that were previously thought possible only for humans. dlt has the potential to create consensus over data among a group of participants in untrustworthy environments. in recent research, both technologies are used in similar and even the same systems. this can lead to a convergence of ai and dlt, which in the past, has paved the way for major innovations of other information technologies. previous work highlights several potential benefits of a convergence of ai and dlt but only provides a limited theoretical framework to describe upcoming real-world integration cases of both technologies. in this research, we review and synthesize extant research on integrating ai with dlt and vice versa to rigorously develop a future research agenda on the convergence of both technologies. in terms of integrating ai with dlt, we identified research opportunities in the areas of secure dlt, automated referee and governance, and privacy-preserving personalization. with regard to integrating dlt with ai, we identified future research opportunities in the areas of decentralized computing for ai, secure data sharing and marketplaces, explainable ai, and coordinating devices. in doing so, this research provides a four-fold contribution. first, it is not constrained to blockchain but instead investigates the broader phenomenon of dlt. second, it considers the reciprocal nature of a convergence of ai and dlt. third, it bridges the gap between theory and practice by helping researchers active in ai or dlt to overcome current limitations in their field, and practitioners to develop systems along with the convergence of both technologies. fourth, it demonstrates the feasibility of applying the convergence concept to research on ai and dlt.\",\"will we work in twenty-first century capitalism? a critique of the fourth industrial revolution literature. the fourth industrial revolution has become a prominent concept and imminent technological change a major issue. facets are everyone\\u2019s concern but currently no one\\u2019s ultimate responsibility (perhaps a little like financial stability before the global financial crisis). in this paper, we argue that the future is being shaped now by the way the fourth industrial revolution is being positioned. whilst no one has set out to argue for or defend technological determinism, anxiety combined with passivity and complacency are being produced in the context of a quasi-determinism. the contingent quantification of the future with regard to the potential for job displacement provides an influential source of authority for this position. a background narrative of \\u2018the future is coming, so you better get used to it\\u2019 is being disseminated. this favours a capitalism that may \\u2018deny work to the many\\u2019 perspective rather than a more fundamental rethink that encompasses change that may liberate the many from work. this, in turn, positions workers and responsibility for future employment, reducing the urgency of calls for wider societal preparation. public understanding and policy are thus affected and along with them the future of work.\",\"preference for human (vs. robotic) labor is stronger in symbolic consumption contexts. advances in robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence increasingly enable firms to replace human labor with technology, thereby fundamentally transforming how goods and services are produced. from both managerial and societal points of view, it is therefore important to understand demand-side incentives for firms to employ human labor. we begin to address this question by examining for which products and services consumers are more likely to favor human (vs. robotic) labor. in six studies, we demonstrate that consumers prefer human (vs. robotic) labor more for products with higher (vs. lower) symbolic value (e.g., when expressing something about one's beliefs and personality is of greater importance). we theorize that this is because consumers have stronger uniqueness motives in more (vs. less) symbolic consumption contexts (and associate human labor more strongly with product uniqueness). in line with this account, we demonstrate that individual differences in need for uniqueness moderate the interaction between production mode and symbolic motives and that a measure of uniqueness motives mediates the effect of consumption context on preferences for human (vs. robotic) production.\",\"technology roadmap development process (trdp) for the service sector: a conceptual framework. this paper provides a decision making framework for development of technology roadmaps by integrating emerging technology intelligence with established decision making and product development methods. this paper integrates the following methods: technology mining, analytic hierarchy process, and technology roadmapping specifically the emphasis is pointed towards service industry where research has indicated major differences exist when compared to the manufacturing industries. the framework is detailed in the paper providing a platform for practitioners to adopt for their own decisions to make and for researchers to expand by applying it to different service industries.\",\"impacts of digitization on auditing: a delphi study for germany. the ongoing digitization of the economy presents challenges and opportunities for the auditing profession and requires both auditors and their clients to adapt. against the background of current technological developments in big data analytics, artificial intelligence (ai), and blockchain technology, this study examines changes in auditing practices expected by german auditing professionals within the next five to ten years. it addresses the perception of auditing, the auditor\\u2013client relationship, regulations, structural and procedural changes for auditing firms, and the profile of the auditing profession. these will probably change with new technologies. we surveyed experts as part of a delphi study in germany conducted over two rounds. the results show that no far-reaching changes are expected within the given time horizon. the annual audit will increasingly evolve toward a continuous audit approach. despite predominantly uncertain opinions, experts believe that new technologies will not replace the auditor, but rather will provide relief and support. even if the job's necessary requirements make it more difficult to remain in the profession, disruptive effects in auditors\\u2019 workplaces are not expected in the near future. nevertheless, the consequences of using new technologies in the auditing process offer numerous future research opportunities.\",\"the complexity of the intangible digital economy: an agent-based model. during the last decades, we have witnessed a strong development of intangible digital technologies. software, artificial intelligence and algorithms are increasingly affecting both production systems and our lives; economists have started to figure out the long-run complex economic implications of this new technological wave. in this paper, we address this question through the agent-based modelling approach. in particular, we enrich the macroeconomic model eurace with the concept of intangible digital technology and investigate its effects both at the micro and macro level. results show the emergence of the relevant stylized facts observed in the business domain, such as increasing returns, winner-take-most phenomena and market lock-in. at the macro level, our main finding is an increasing unemployment level, since the sizeable decrease of the employment rate in the mass-production system, provided by the higher productivity of digital assets, is usually not counterbalanced by the new jobs created in the digital sector.\",\"ai-enabled business-model innovation and transformation in industrial ecosystems: a framework, model and outline for further research. manufacturing incumbents find it difficult to integrate ai in their traditional business models. this paper draws on the research question: how does manufacturing incumbents use ai for enabling business model innovation in industrial ecosystems? we use qualitative method in order to study four large global manufacturing incumbents that are transforming their business models with ai. we performed more than 30 semi-structured in-depth interviews with strategic key personnel in order to understand how they have succeeded with implementing ai and transforming business models. our main contribution establishes the need for ai business-model innovation to be aligned with ecosystem innovation. specifically, in short-term incumbents may use ecosystem reconfiguration strategy, whereas long-term strategies relate to ecosystem revitalization, and resilience. thus, we contribute by connecting organizational microelements with ecosystem macro dimensions and provide an evolutionary model envisioning how incumbents attempt to promote strategic transitions in their firms and ecosystems.\",\"frontline encounters of the ai kind: an evolved service encounter framework. artificial intelligence (ai) is radically transforming frontline service encounters, with ai increasingly playing the role of employee or customer. programmed to speak or write like a human, ai is poised to usher in a frontline service revolution. no longer will frontline encounters between customer and employee be simply human-to-human; rather, researchers must consider an evolved paradigm where each actor could be either human or ai. further complicating this 2 \\u00d7 2 framework is whether the human, either customer or employee, recognizes when they are interacting with a non-human exchange partner. accordingly, we develop an evolved service encounter framework and, in doing so, introduce the concept of counterfeit service, interspecific service (ai-to-human), interai service (ai-to-ai), and offer a research agenda focused on the implementation of ai in dyadic service exchanges.\",\"how relevant are risk perceptions, effort, and performance expectancy in mobile banking adoption?. this article provides a comprehensive overview of the adoption process using evidence from m-banking adoption in pakistan. a survey design was used and 189 responses were received from across pakistan and analyzed using smart pls application. findings suggest that research on the effect of risk in the adoption process remains inconclusive. contrarily, consumers have overcome many fears due to the usefulness, indispensability, high security features, and effort expended in the use of financial services delivered through m-banking. perceived risk\\u2019s (pr) direct influence was found to be generally weak. however, pr plays a major role in the pre-adoption process because it\\u2019s weak and direct inhibiting influence become an \\u201cenhancer\\u201d in the association between effort expectancy (ee) and the three key tam\\u002futaut constructs [performance expectancy (pe), attitude (att), and adoption intention (int)]. most importantly, the role of ee as a strong driver of pe,

growth?\\u2014evidence from china. as the driving force behind the new wave of technological advancement, artificial intelligence (ai) paves the way for a new era of green economic growth. this paper uses the case of china and constructs a relevant mathematical model to propose the two-way impact of ai on green total factor productivity (gtfp) and systematically analyze the impact of ai on green economic growth. the main findings of this study are that ai has a significant \\u201cu-shaped\\u201d effect on gtfp, which was estimated using a nonlinear dynamic panel regression model. the analysis of regional heterogeneity shows that improving ai in resource-rich areas can boost gtfp and break the \\u201cresource curse\\u201d. the \\u201cproductivity paradox\\u201d arises, according to the industry heterogeneity analysis, because the current low level of intelligence in resource-intensive and labor-intensive industries fails to improve gtfp. this paper also breaks down gtfp into green technological progress and green efficiency improvement effects to figure out how ai affects green economic growth.\",\"the risks of digitalization and the adaptation of regional labor markets in russia. the implementation of new automation technologies together with the development of artificial intelligence can free up a significant amount of labor. this sharply increases the risks of digital transformation. at the same time, certain regions and cities differ greatly in their ability to adapt to future changes. in this article, we seek to determine the capabilities of russian regions to reduce risks and adapt to digital transformation. the literature stipulates that there are several factors able to reduce these risks. first of all, they are associated with retraining, ict and steam-technologies\\u2019 development, the promotion of economic activities that are less subject to automation. as a result of econometric calculations, we identified several factors that contribute to the new industries\\u2019 development (in our case, ict development), and, accordingly, increase regional adaptivity. these factors include diversification, the concentration of human capital, favorable entrepreneurship conditions, the creative potential of residents, and the development of ict infrastructure. we identified several regions with high social risks and low adaptivity, which are mainly the poorly developed regions of southern russia, where entrepreneurial risks are high, steam specialists are not trained, shadow economy is large. this work contributes policy tools for adaptation to digital transformation.\",\"strategy development in small and medium sized enterprises for sustainability and increased value creation. sustainability strategies create many synergistic effects for smes working collaboratively, as well as systemic benefits for the commons. after setting forth the business case for sustainable smes, and considering sme sustainability advantages in contrast to mnes, this paper discusses several different incentives for smes to optimize sustainability: (1) becoming valuable sustainable investment targets for larger firms; (2) creating highly competitive networks of sustainable smes in market spaces where large enterprises are less successful; (3) becoming highly efficient suppliers in global supply chains through sustainable practices. while several successful models of the sustainable sme are evolving, it may be that networks of smes will become essential for addressing the systemic problems that underlie industrial ecology, enterprise resilience, and global supply chain sustainability. smes represent the majority of all enterprises, and rapidly evolving communication technologies allow for various routes of network formation.\",\"influence of artificial intelligence on technological innovation: evidence from the panel data of china's manufacturing sectors. this paper analyzes the impact of artificial intelligence (ai) on technological innovation through logic reasoning and empirical modeling. based on the industrial robot data provided by the international federation of robotics (ifr) and the panel data of china's 14 manufacturing sectors from 2008 to 2017, this paper empirically analyzes the impact of ai on technological innovation. our analysis shows that the mechanism of how ai affects technological innovation is that the former promotes technological innovation through accelerating knowledge creation and technology spillover, improving learning and absorptive capacities, while increasing r&d and talent investment. our empirical results indicate that under the condition of controlling intensity of r&d investment, fdi, ownership structure, technical imitation, ai significantly promotes technological innovation. and the impact of ai on technological innovation experiences sector heterogeneity: ai has more significant impact on the technological innovation of low-tech sectors. the higher the level of ai, the greater its impact on technological innovation. based on our established conclusions, we provide corresponding suggestions and recommendations for managerial decision-making.\",\"psychological reactions to human versus robotic job replacement. advances in robotics and artificial intelligence are increasingly enabling organizations to replace humans with intelligent machines and algorithms1. forecasts predict that, in the coming years, these new technologies will affect millions of workers in a wide range of occupations, replacing human workers in numerous tasks2,3, but potentially also in whole occupations1,4,5. despite the intense debate about these developments in economics, sociology and other social sciences, research has not examined how people react to the technological replacement of human labour. we begin to address this gap by examining the psychology of technological replacement. our investigation reveals that people tend to prefer workers to be replaced by other human workers (versus robots); however, paradoxically, this preference reverses when people consider the prospect of their own job loss. we further demonstrate that this preference reversal occurs because being replaced by machines, robots or software (versus other humans) is associated with reduced self-threat. in contrast, being replaced by robots is associated with a greater perceived threat to one\\u2019s economic future. these findings suggest that technological replacement of human labour has unique psychological consequences that should be taken into account by policy measures (for example, appropriately tailoring support programmes for the unemployed).\",\"artificial intelligence and emerging digital technologies in the energy sector. digitalization is an increasingly important direction of energy innovation moving forward. nevertheless, which emerging digital technology is more crucial during the energy sector transformation stays underexplored. using a near-universe of online job postings data collected between 2010 and 2019, we show that among the emerging digital technologies (i.e., artificial intelligence, big data, internet of things, robotics, blockchain technology, and cloud computing), artificial intelligence is the most widely adopted in the energy sector. we further calculate a systematic measure of the emerging digital technology intensity in job skill requirements and show that artificial intelligence proves to be the most valuable in the energy sector, either from the employee's or the employer's perspective. particularly, artificial intelligence brings the highest wage premium to the average wage of the adopted energy firm and the local labor market. meanwhile, artificial intelligence contributes the most to energy firms\\u2019 performance. our findings suggest that energy firms should intentionally increase the requirement for artificial intelligence in hiring new talents. our findings also indicate that major energy firms should take the leading role in adopting the emerging digital technologies to enjoy the predominant advantage as early as possible.\",\"is automation labor share\\u2013displacing? productivity growth, employment, and the labor share. many technological innovations replace workers with machines. but this capital\\u2013labor substitution need not reduce aggregate labor demand, because it simultaneously induces four countervail-ing responses: own-industry output effects; cross-industry input\\u2013output effects; between-industry shifts; and final demand effects. we quantify these channels using four decades of harmonized cross-country and industry data, whereby we measure automation as industry-level movements in total factor productivity that are common across countries. we find that automation displaces employment and reduces labor\\u2019s share of value added in the industries where it originates (a direct effect). in the case of employment, these own-industry losses are reversed by indirect gains in customer industries and induced increases in aggregate demand. by contrast, own-industry labor share losses are not recouped elsewhere. our framework can account for a substantial fraction of the reallocation of employment across industries and the aggregate fall in the labor share over the last three decades. it does not, however, explain why the labor share fell more rapidly during the 2000s.\",\"digital transformation, development and productivity in developing countries: is artificial intelligence a curse or a blessing?. purpose: the entire world is now witnessing the fourth industrial revolution and artificial intelligence (ai) is indeed altering the lives of the many in both developing and developed countries. massive digital transformations are affecting the economies of those countries and are bringing with them many promised merits, as well as many challenges to face. this paper aims to examine the relationship between digital transformation (as a one facet of the fourth revolution and ai trends) on one side, and economic development, labor productivity and employment on the other side. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the paper analyzes different indices of digital transformation, and then uses the digital evolution index (dei) to study those relationships in a group of developing countries using feasible generalized least squares method (fgls). findings: the results show a positive relationship between the digital transformation index and economic development, labor productivity and job employment. females seem to gain more from digital transformation compared to males, as suggested by the positive relation with the first and the insignificant relation with the latter. the relationship with vulnerable employment is not significant; more evidence is still needed to judge whether digital transformation will have an impact upon the vulnerable employees in the economy. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the paper focused on the impact of digital transformation upon total aggregate employment. future research is still needed to examine the impact upon the structure of the labor market and the shift of occupations. originality\\u002fvalue: the paper aims to add to in the literature regarding the relationship between digital transformation, economic development, employment and productivity in the developing world. the implications of those relationships are of significant importance to policymakers regarding how much support should be given to encourage the digital transformation. at the same time, it shall also indicate how much social support policies are

transformation that is comparable across the chosen set of developing countries, instead of using single indices each capturing a different dimension of digital transformation.\",\"what impacts customer experience for b2b enterprises on using ai-enabled chatbots? insights from big data analytics. many b2b firms have widely accepted ai-based chatbots to provide human-like service interaction at different customer touchpoints in recent years. one of the objectives behind introducing this technology is to provide an enhanced, live channel customer experience (cx) all round the clock. researchers have focused on delivering the cx by improvising the chatbot's internal algorithm, giving limited attention to cx theories from management literature, which leaves a gap. with the proposed paper, we have investigated the influencing factors of ai-based chatbots from the lens of cx theories for b2b firms. in this paper, a model for organizing cx has been proposed using the diffusion of innovation theory, trust commitment theory, information systems success model, and hoffman & novak's flow model for the computer-mediated environment and verified using the social media data. the methodology used for this study is the social media analytics-based content analysis method (sentiment analysis, hierarchical clustering, topic modeling) for data preparation, followed by lasso and ridge regression for model verification. the results suggest that cx in b2b enterprises using chatbots is influenced by these bots' overall system design, customers' ability to use technology, and customer trust towards brand and system.\",\"the impact of artificial intelligence on labor productivity. recent evidence indicates an upsurge in artificial intelligence and robotics (ai) patenting activities in the latest years, suggesting that solutions based on ai technologies might have started to exert an effect on the economy. we test this hypothesis using a worldwide sample of 5257 companies having filed at least a patent related to the field of ai between 2000 and 2016. our analysis shows that, once controlling for other patenting activities, ai patent applications generate an extra-positive effect on companies\\u2019 labor productivity. the effect concentrates on smes and services industries, suggesting that the ability to quickly readjust and introduce ai-based applications in the production process is an important determinant of the impact of ai observed to date.\",\"opportunities of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the food industry. the food processing and handling industry is the most significant business among the various manufacturing industries in the entire world that subsidize the highest employability. the human workforce plays an essential role in the smooth execution of the production and packaging of food products. due to the involvement of humans, the food industries are failing to maintain the demand-supply chain and also lacking in food safety. to overcome these issues of food industries, industrial automation is the best possible solution. automation is completely based on artificial intelligence (ai) or machine learning (ml) or deep learning (dl) algorithms. by using the ai-based system, food production and delivery processes can be efficiently handled and also enhance the operational competence. this article is going to explain the ai applications in the food industry which recommends a huge amount of capital saving with maximizing resource utilization by reducing human error. artificial intelligence with data science can improve the quality of restaurants, cafes, online delivery food chains, hotels, and food outlets by increasing production utilizing different fitting algorithms for sales prediction. ai could significantly improve packaging, increasing shelf life, a combination of the menu by using ai algorithms, and food safety by making a more transparent supply chain management system. with the help of ai and ml, the future of food industries is completely based on smart farming, robotic farming, and drones.\",\"inspiration choices that matter: the selection of external stimuli during ideation. inspiration is a widely recognized phenomenon in everyday life. however, researchers still know very little about what the process of inspiration entails. this paper investigates designers' approaches when selecting inspirational stimuli during the initial phases of a design process.we conducted a think-aloud protocol study and interviews with 31 design masters students while generating ideas for a design problem. the results indicate that searching for and selecting stimuli require different levels of cognitive effort, depending on whether there is unlimited or limited access to stimuli. furthermore, three important stages of the inspiration process were identified: keyword definition, stimuli search and stimuli selection. for each of these stages, we elaborate on how designers define keywords, which search approaches they use and what drives their selection of stimuli. this paper contributes to an understanding of how designers can be supported in their inspiration process in a more detailed manner.\",\"between security and convenience: facial recognition technology in the eyes of citizens in china, germany, the united kingdom, and the united states. how does the public perceive facial recognition technology and how much do they accept facial recognition technology in different political contexts? based on online surveys resembling the internet-connected population in china, germany, the united kingdom, and the united states, our study finds that facial recognition technology enjoys generally highest acceptance among respondents in china, while acceptance is lowest in germany, and the united kingdom and the united states are in between. a closer examination through the lens of an integrated technology acceptance model reveals interesting variations in the selected four countries based, among other factors, on socio-demographic factors as well as perceived consequences, usefulness, and reliability of facial recognition technology. while previous research has pointed out that facial recognition technology is an instrument for state surveillance and control, this study shows that surveillance and control are not foremost on the minds of citizens in china, germany, the united kingdom, and the united states, but rather notions of convenience and improved security.\",\"extending the understanding of mobile banking adoption: when utaut meets ttf and itm. mobile banking (mbanking) enables customers to carry out their banking tasks via mobile devices. we advance the extant body of knowledge about mbanking adoption by proposing a model for understanding the importance and relationship between the user perception of mbanking, initial trust in mbanking services, and the fit between the technology and mbanking task characteristics. we synergistically combine the strengths of three is theories - task technology fit (ttf) model, unified theory of acceptance and usage of technology (utaut), and initial trust model (itm). the model was tested in a study conducted in portugal, one of the european union (eu) countries with the highest mobile phone adoption. based on the sample of 194 individuals we applied partial least squares (pls) to test the conceptual model propose. the path significance levels were estimated using the bootstrapping method (500 resamples). the study found that facilitating conditions and behavioral intentions directly influence mbanking adoption. initial trust, performance expectancy, technology characteristics, and task technology fit have total effect on behavioral intention. the paper offers valuable insights to decision-makers involved in the implementation and deployment of mbanking services. for researchers, the paper highlights the usefulness of integrating ttf, utaut and itm in the development of a decision support framework to study the adoption of new technologies.\",\"exploring technological opportunities by linking technology and products: application of morphology analysis and text mining. the technological opportunity discovery (tod) can be divided into two types: anticipating new technology and applying existing technology. the latter is useful for small and medium companies, which have weak technology forecasting capability. thus, this research aims to suggest the methodology for the tod based on existing technology by using morphology analysis and text mining. the extracted results of tod are classified into three categories based on the types of product - existing, applied, and heterogeneous product. to illustrate the process and validate the utility of application, led heat dissipation technology and led lamps are selected as the technology and product for the illustration. the method contributes to suggest a semi-automated normative method for technology forecasting by combining morphology analysis and text mining.\",\"on design 'problematization': theorising differences in designed outcomes. this paper offers a speculative account of the way in which architectural design problems are 'solved', and of the significant ways in which such problems are constructed by the designers themselves. deliberately retaining pro tem the traditional 'problem-solution' language frame, the paper questions this viewpoint by positing a distinction between two categories of problem: the 'problem as given' and the 'problem as design goal'. while the first represents a conventional understanding of the problem presented for solution, the paper speculates that this is not the problem that the designer seeks to solve. a second category is therefore introduced to delineate the problem that is actually solved. this problem, termed the 'problem as design goal', is created by the imposition on to the 'problem as given' of a range of designer preferences, expectations and prejudices which not only define the 'actual' problem but, at the same time, establish the means and requirements for its acceptable solution. such 'problematization', different for each designer and for each project, is posited as being central to architectural design, informing and constraining both the design activity and the final outcome in ways that are not determined by the brief itself.\",\"ai feel you: customer experience assessment via chatbot interviews. purpose: while customer experience (ce) is recognized as a critical determinant of business success, both academics and managers are yet to find a means to gain a comprehensive understanding of ce cost-effectively. the authors argue that the application of relevant ai technology could help address this challenge. employing interactively prompted narrative storytelling, and the authors investigate the effectiveness of sentiment analysis (sa) on extracting valuable ce insights from primary qualitative data generated via chatbot interviews. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: drawing on a granular and semantically clear framework for studying ce feelings, an artificial intelligence (ai) augmented chatbot was designed. the chatbot interviewed a crowdsourced sample of consumers about their recalled service experience feelings. by combining free-text and closed-ended questions, the authors were able to compare extracted sentiment polarities against established measurement scales and empirically validate our novel approach. findings: the authors demonstrate that sa can effectively extract ce feelings from primary chatbot data. this findings also suggest that further enhancement in accuracy can be achieved via improvements in the interplay between the chatbot interviewer and sa extraction algorithms. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the proposed customer-centric approach can help service companies to study and better understand ce feelings in a cost-effective and scalable manner. the ai-augmented chatbots can also help companies to foster immersive and engaging relationships with customers. this study focuses on feelings, warranting further research on ai's value in studying other ce elements. originality\\u002fvalue: the unique inquisitive role of ai-infused chatbots in conducting interviews and analyzing data in realtime, offers considerable potential for studying ce and other subjective constructs.\",\"carbon emission reduction effects of industrial robot applications: heterogeneity characteristics and influencing mechanisms. industrial robots are a key enabling technology of industry 4.0 and the artificial intelligence revolution, which is of great significance in sustainable development. existing research has focused on the economic effects of industrial robot application, but research on the environmental effects remains insufficient. based on the environmental kuznets curve (ekc) model and using sample data from 35 countries from 1993 to 2017, this paper empirically examines the carbon emission reduction effects of industrial robot application. three key findings emerged. first, the application of industrial robots significantly reduces carbon intensity. the application of industrial robots leads to increased productivity, the optimisation of factor structures, and technological innovation in production, which improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon intensity. second, there is a two-dimensional heterogeneity in the carbon intensity reduction effects of industrial robot application in terms of the application fields and possible countries for application. compared to other fields, the application of industrial robots in manufacturing, agriculture, and electricity, gas, and water supply fields significantly promotes carbon intensity reduction. furthermore, industrial robots in developed countries have better emission reduction effects than in developing countries. third, the application of industrial robots has a dual-channel mediating mechanism for carbon intensity reduction: first, there is a mediating role of green total factor productivity and energy intensity; second, absorptive capacity plays a moderating role. on the one hand, high absorptive capacity brings about a better innovation environment and enhances the effects of carbon emission reduction; on the other hand, the application of industrial robots promotes carbon intensity reduction by positively influencing the improvement of green total factor productivity and energy intensity. finally, policy recommendations are provided based on the results.\",\"iot data visualization for business intelligence in corporate finance.

energy, the transmission of information, the management of users, assets and processes, the operation of businesses and companies have been progressively digitalized. the main challenges of a smart city is its definition, scope and interconnections; there are different approaches to smart city implementations that vary from collaborative multidisciplinary environments, the addition of information and communications technology (ict) within its physical fabric to the use of big data for higher abstraction decisions. this paper presents the concept of digital as a service (daas), where any complete digitalization can be implemented independently of its associated physical infrastructure in a cloud environment; dass would enable an interoperable virtual digital infrastructure (vdi). in addition, this paper reviews the current digital systems, transmission networks, servers and management systems. the next industrial revolution will be founded on artificial intelligence that will entirely replace humans by taking production and management decisions based on the internet of things (iot), the cloud, blockchain, big data, virtual reality and the combination of digital and real infrastructure or city. digital as a service would be its enabler by providing the entire interconnection, integration and virtualization of its space, services and structure (3s).\",\"consumers\\u2019 reasons and perceived value co-creation of using artificial intelligence-enabled travel service agents. this study analyzes the relationship between consumers\\u2019 values and their reasons for and against perceived value co-creation as well as their behavioral intentions related to using artificial intelligence (ai)-enabled travel service agents (chatbots). structual equation modeling (sem) results mainly support the hypotheses driven by the behavioral reasoning theory (brt) but presume that one means lead to usage intentions of ai-enabled travel service agents. given the interdependency and complexity of consumers\\u2019 reasoning processes, in addition, fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsqca) is conducted to provide more insight into this unexplored topic presuming multiple different trajectories. the complex solutions of fsqca indicate that four different combinations sufficiently explain consumers\\u2019 intent to use ai-enabled travel service agents. overall, the findings shed light on a new area of consumer behavior and the acceptance of ai-enabled service encounters.\",\"seven paradoxes of business process management in a hyper-connected world. business process management is a boundary-spanning discipline that aligns operational capabilities and technology to design and manage business processes. the digital transformation has enabled human actors, information systems, and smart products to interact with each other via multiple digital channels. the emergence of this hyper-connected world greatly leverages the prospects of business processes \\u2013 but also boosts their complexity to a new level. we need to discuss how the bpm discipline can find new ways for identifying, analyzing,

systems handle the same problems. collaboration among providers, combined with government support, will help advance widespread consumer adoption of online health care.\",\"trust me, i'm a bot \\u2013 repercussions of chatbot disclosure in different service frontline settings. purpose: chatbots are increasingly prevalent in the service frontline. due to advancements in artificial intelligence, chatbots are often indistinguishable from humans. regarding the question whether firms should disclose their chatbots' nonhuman identity or not, previous studies find negative consumer reactions to chatbot disclosure. by considering the role of trust and service-related context factors, this study explores how negative effects of chatbot disclosure for customer retention can be prevented. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this paper presents two experimental studies that examine the effect of disclosing the nonhuman identity of chatbots on customer retention. while the first study examines the effect of chatbot disclosure for different levels of service criticality, the second study considers different service outcomes. the authors employ analysis of covariance and mediation analysis to test their hypotheses. findings: chatbot disclosure has a negative indirect effect on customer retention through mitigated trust for services with high criticality. in cases where a chatbot fails to handle the customer's service issue, disclosing the chatbot identity not only lacks negative impact but even elicits a positive effect on retention. originality\\u002fvalue: the authors provide evidence that customers will react differently to chatbot disclosure depending on the service frontline setting. they show that chatbot disclosure does not only have undesirable consequences as previous studies suspect but can lead to positive reactions as well. by doing so, the authors draw a more balanced picture on the consequences of chatbot disclosure.\",\"how user perceptions influence software use. traditionally, human-computer interaction researchers have focused on a system's usability. the authors applied an mis-proven technology acceptance model that

chatbots. purpose: drawing on the self-determination theory, the assemblage theory and customer experience literature, this paper aims to develop a framework to understand motivational customer experiences with chatbots. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this paper uses a multimethod approach to examine the interaction between individuals and airlines\\u2019 chatbots. three components of self-determined interaction with the chatbot (competence, autonomy and relatedness) and five components of the customer\\u2013chatbot experience (sensory, intellectual, affective, behavioral and social) are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. findings: the findings confirm the direct influence of self-determined interaction on customer experience and the direct effects of these two constructs on participants\\u2019 attitudes toward and satisfaction with the chatbot. the model also supports the mediating roles of customer experience and attitude toward the chatbot. practical implications: this paper offers managers a broad understanding of individuals\\u2019 interactions with chatbots through three elements: motivation to use chatbots, experiential responses and individuals\\u2019 valuation of whether the interactions have amplified (or limited) the outcomes obtained from the experience. originality\\u002fvalue: this paper contributes to the hospitality and

bibliometric analysis of research on big data analytics for business and management. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to scrutinize and classify the literature linking big data analytics and management phenomena. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: an objective bibliometric analysis is conducted, supported by subjective assessments based on the studies focused on the intertwining of big data analytics and management fields. specifically, deeper descriptive statistics and document co-citation analysis are provided. findings: from the document co-citation analysis and its evaluation, four clusters depicting literature linking big data analytics and management phenomena are revealed: theoretical development of big data analytics; management transition to big data analytics; big data analytics and firm resources, capabilities and performance; and big data analytics for supply chain management. originality\\u002fvalue: to the best of the authors\\u2019 knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to comprehend the research streams which, over time, have paved the way to the intersection between big data analytics and management fields.\",\"virtual product experience and customer participation-a chance for customer-centred, really new products. this paper demonstrates how customers can be virtually integrated into a company's innovation process. new interaction tools allow companies to gain valuable input from customers via the internet. first, we explain why too closely listening to customers may turn out to be problematic for the development of real new products. the kano model shows that it is difficult for customers to express their latent needs as well as those which are taken for granted. new virtual interaction tools and virtual product experiences help to overcome these problems and enable customers to transfer their explicit and implicit knowledge to innovation teams. how to apply virtual interaction tools and how to virtually integrate customers into the innovation process in practice is illustrated in detail in the audi case study. our case study findings show that virtual customer integration provides valuable input for new product development. this paper introduces virtual customer integration as a new means of coming up with customer-centred, really new products.\",\"digitalization of work and entry into entrepreneurship. we investigate the relationship of the new wave of digitalization of occupations with entry into different types of entrepreneurship in the united states, including entry into digital entrepreneurship. based on the current population survey for 2011\\u201318 and using different measures of digitalization that reflect its destructive and transformative impacts on occupations, we provide evidence that digitalization is significantly associated with entrepreneurial entry at the individual level. the results suggest that high-skilled employees and employees in ict occupations facing destructive digitalization have an increased likelihood of becoming entrepreneurs with unincorporated businesses. however, entrepreneurship does not seem to be a viable option for low-skilled individuals affected by destructive digitalization. we further find that starting an incorporated business is more likely and starting an unincorporated business is less likely for employees facing transformative digitalization. apparently, advances in ai create opportunities for growth-oriented entrepreneurship, but also increase the opportunity cost of less ambitious entrepreneurship.\",\"on the development of a technology intelligence tool for identifying technology opportunity. technology intelligence tools have come to be regarded as vital components in planning for technology development and formulating technology strategies. however, most such tools currently focus on providing graphical frameworks and databases to support the process of technology analysis. techpioneer, the proposed tool in this paper, aims to offer decisive information in order to identify technology opportunities. to this end, the system uses textual information from technological document databases and applies morphology analysis to derive promising alternatives and conjoint analysis to evaluate their priority. in addition, the method used in developing a technology dictionary is presented, employing clustering and network analysis. this system also has the ability to communicate with experts in order to estimate the value of existing patents, which is inevitable for the priority-setting of alternatives, construct a morphological matrix and so on. this paper presents the system architecture and functions of this tool and moreover, illustrates the prototype implementation and case study of the same.\",\"demographics and automation. we argue theoretically and document empirically that aging leads to greater (industrial) automation, because it creates a shortage of middle-aged workers specializing in manual production tasks. we show that demographic change is associated with greater adoption of robots and other automation technologies across countries and with more robotics-related activities across u.s. commuting zones. we also document more automation innovation in countries undergoing faster aging. our directed technological change model predicts that the response of automation technologies to aging should be more pronounced in industries that rely more on middle-aged workers and those that present greater opportunities for automation and that productivity should improve and the labor share should decline relatively in industries that are more amenable to automation. the evidence supports all four of these predictions.\",\"can mobile and biometric payments replace cards in the korean offline payments market? consumer preference analysis for payment systems using a discrete choice model. the convenience of mobile and biometric payments are making these systems increasingly popular in the korean offline payments market. however, the diffusion of alternative offline payment systems such as mobile or biometric payments is slower than expected. therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze consumer preferences for payment systems and examine the effects of consumers\\u2019 characteristics on the marginal utility of mobile and biometric payments. it uses the discrete choice experiment consisting of five major attributes to estimate preference parameters, and analyzes the data using the mixed logit model. the results show that consumers preferred cards to mobile and biometric payments even if they displayed the same level of related attributes. the scenario analysis results based on consumer preferences also showed the need to develop the overall attribute level of mobile and biometric payments. furthermore, consumers\\u2019 positive attitude or innovativeness toward hi-tech products has a significantly positive effect on preferences for alternative payments. based on the results, this study provides theoretical implications for consumer preference studies on payment systems and proposes market strategies for the diffusion of major next-generation payment systems from multiple aspects.\",\"embodied and disembodied technological change: the sectoral patterns of job-creation and job-destruction. this paper addresses, both theoretically and empirically, the sectoral patterns of job creation and job destruction in order to distinguish the alternative effects of

sectors, while expansionary investment does so in the \\u201cdownstream\\u201d industries. however, these labour-friendly impacts are barely significant from a statistical point of view. conversely, the replacement of obsolete capital vintages tends to exert a negative impact on labour demand and this effect turns out to be highly significant.\",\"algorithm awareness: why user awareness is critical for personal privacy in the adoption of algorithmic platforms?. understanding how algorithms shape users\\u2019 online experiences is a prerequisite to developing an effective algorithm design. due to the rapid algorithmification of platforms, it is timely to examine users\\u2019 awareness of algorithms on online platforms because these algorithms can shape everyday decisions and interactions through mediating, gatekeeping, and structuring user interactions. focusing on the role of algorithm awareness (aa) in the privacy calculus process, we investigate users\\u2019 intention to disclose personal information when using a platform with personalized algorithms. by conceptualizing aa with a range of theoretical and behavioral variables, we examine how users\\u2019 self-efficacy affects their privacy concerns when they adopt, consume, and interact with such platforms. the findings show that aa leads users to envisage, understand, and interact with algorithms depending on their understanding of the control of the information flow embedded within them. the awareness that users have regarding algorithms influences the trust of algorithmic processes and the way users evaluate privacy concerns and self-disclosures. the cognitive user processes of aa provide conceptual frameworks for algorithm design and a practical guideline for the design of personalized algorithms.\",\"factors influencing adoption of payments banks by indian customers: extending utaut with perceived credibility. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors influencing the behavioral intention to adopt payments banks services by indian underbanked and unbanked population. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the proposed model has assimilated factors from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) along with perceived credibility. the factors of utaut include performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitation of conditions and social influence. apart from testing the direct relationships of the model constructs with the behavioral intention to adopt payments banks services, the study has also explored mediating and moderating effects of certain constructs. the research model has been empirically tested using 660 responses from a field survey conducted in new delhi \\u2013 the capital city of india \\u2013 by using the structured equation modeling (sem) technique. the target respondents of the study are small businessmen and migrant laborers who are either underbanked or unbanked. findings: the findings of the study reveal that the model is able to explain 67.5 per cent of the variance in behavioral intention. the results indicate that all the factors are direct determinants of behavioral intention. perceived credibility is found to be the strongest influencer of behavioral intention. the findings also indicate that perceived credibility partially mediates the relationships between \\u201csocial influence and behavioral intention\\u201d and \\u201cperformance expectancy and behavioral intention.\\u201d the relationship between performance expectancy and behavioral intention is also found to be moderated by facilitating conditions and effort expectancy. research limitations\\u002fimplications: as this study is based on a convenience sample of respondents of only one city of india, this could negatively reflect on the generalizability of results across other cities. moreover, the study has only focused on the perceptions of small businessmen and migrant laborers. this raises concerns regarding the applicability of the results for other segments of the current population that have different demographic characteristics (e.g. occupation, income, education level and technology experience). modifying the conceptual model presented in this research to include \\u201cexperience\\u201d and \\u201cage\\u201d as moderators can also be worth considering in future. although this study has extended the utaut to include perceived credibility, the results of the explanatory power of the model indicate that there is still room for improvement. therefore, including other constructs, e.g. hedonic motivation, perceived risks and trialability, could be a fruitful path forward. future studies may also examine the factors influencing the actual use behavior of payments banks, rather than just behavioral intention. practical implications: the study looks forward to providing the payments banks service providers in india with suitable guidelines for effectively implementing and designing payments banks services. specifically, the results of this study have provided clues for indian payments banks service providers about the crucial role of perceived credibility in influencing the behavioral intention to adopt payments banks. therefore, service providers have to initially be sure that payments banks are able to conduct financial transactions efficiently, securely and within less time, along with the availability of information required by customers to successfully use the services. service providers should enhance customer confidence and trust by providing secure and reliable services. they should also emphasize on the positive safety measures of the payments banks during any marketing campaign rather than just creating brand awareness. originality\\u002fvalue: the study represents a substantial contribution to the existing knowledge regarding mobile payment channels in particular and technology acceptance area in general. in fact, this study presents a worthwhile direction by examining payments banks services, which, so far, have not been well evaluated in the indian context. to the best of the authors\\u2019 knowledge, this is an early attempt toward a holistic and integrative approach to explain adoption of payments banks in india. although prior studies have addressed mobile banking and mobile payment adoption, the strength of this research lies in combining the utaut constructs with perceived credibility. this is evidenced by the high explanatory power (67.5 per cent) of the research model adopted in this study.\",\"the critical factors affecting e-government adoption in indonesia: a conceptual framework. electronic government (e-government) is the use of information and communication technology by the government to increase the service to citizens. e-government also could be applied to the legislative and judicative to improve internal efficiency of democratic governance. however, technological, governing and social issues have to tread carefully in order to adopt these phenomena. this study aims to find critical factor that influences e-government adoption. furthermore, comprehensive analysis base on the bibliometric technic on various resources has been chosen to guide this work. several dependent variables such as information quality, trust, and system quality also considered relevant were integrated with the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) constructs as examining variables affecting the adoption of e-government. finally, this study found a formulation of the conceptual framework on the basis of existing experience and their relationship.\",\"fourth industrial revolution, digital servitization and relationship quality in italian

particular, the study included 22 italian b2b manufacturing firms whose i4.0-based digital servitization approaches are described and, then, analysed in relation to the quality of supplier\\u2013customer relationships. findings: the access to customers and data is critical to enable advanced digital services and for improving relationship quality; the levels of relational intimacy and informational openness lead to two subsequent levels of data-driven efficiency and data-driven effectiveness, impacting significantly on relationship quality and enabling relational innovation. originality\\u002fvalue: the research explores the link, so far underestimated, between digital servitization and relationship quality in industrial contexts.\",\"spatial heterogeneity and evolution trend of regional green innovation efficiency\\u2013an empirical study based on panel data of industrial enterprises in china's provinces*. green innovation is of great significance to promote high-quality growth of the national economy and reduce the load on the ecological environment. this study constructs a two-stage sbm-dea model including energy and undesirable output to measure green innovation efficiency. tobit model is used to analyze the impact of input variables and influencing factors. the main results are as follows: achievement transformation, technology development and green innovation efficiency in each region all show a trend of fluctuating growth, and green innovation efficiency in the eastern region has always been in a leading position. the total current volumes of r&d personnel and government support strength have a positive relationship and the intensity of r&d funding and environmental protection investment has a negative relationship with the technology development. the number of patent applications and the openness degree to the outside world are positively related to the achievement transformation, and the investment of new products and energy is negatively related to the achievement transformation. through the comparative analysis of the innovation efficiency differences among different regions, the paper analyzes the main influencing factors, and puts forward countermeasures and suggestions to provide certain theoretical reference for the sustainable and healthy development of china's various regions.\",\"smart nudging: how cognitive technologies enable choice architectures for value co-creation. people make decisions and take actions to improve their viability everyday, and they increasingly turn to artificial intelligence (ai) to assist with their decision making. such trends suggest the need to determine how ai and other cognitive technologies affect value co-creation. an integrative framework, based on the service-dominant logic and nudge theory, conceptualizes smart nudging as uses of cognitive technologies to affect people's behaviour predictably, without limiting their options or altering their economic incentives. several choice architectures and nudges affect value co-creation, by (1) widening resource accessibility, (2) extending engagement, or (3) augmenting human actors\\u2019 agency. although cognitive technologies are unlikely to engender smart outcomes alone, they enable designs of conditions and contexts that promote smart behaviours, by amplifying capacities for self-understanding, control, and action. this study offers a conceptualization of actors\\u2019 value co-creation prompted by ai-driven nudged choices, in terms of re-institutionalizing processes that affect agency and practices.\",\"from bpmn process models to dmn decision models. the interplay between process and decision models plays a crucial role in business process management, as decisions may be based on running processes and affect process outcomes. often process models include decisions that are encoded through process control flow structures and data flow elements, thus reducing process model maintainability. the decision model and notation (dmn) was proposed to achieve separation of concerns and to possibly complement the business process model and notation (bpmn) for designing decisions related to process models. nevertheless, deriving decision models from process models remains challenging, especially when the same data underlie both process and decision models. in this paper, we explore how and to which extent the data modeled in bpmn processes and used for decision-making may be represented in the corresponding dmn decision models. to this end, we identify a set of patterns that capture possible representations of data in bpmn processes and that can be used to guide the derivation of decision models related to existing process models. throughout the paper we refer to real-world healthcare processes to show the applicability of the proposed approach.\",\"artificial intelligence and marketing: pitfalls and opportunities. this article discusses the pitfalls and opportunities of ai in marketing through the lenses of knowledge creation and knowledge transfer. first, we discuss the notion of \\u201chigher-order learning\\u201d that distinguishes ai applications from traditional modeling approaches, and while focusing on recent advances in deep neural networks, we cover its underlying methodologies (multilayer perceptron, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks) and learning paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning). second, we discuss the technological pitfalls and dangers marketing managers need to be aware of when implementing ai in their organizations, including the concepts of badly defined objective functions, unsafe or unrealistic learning environments, biased ai, explainable ai, and controllable ai. third, ai will have a deep impact on predictive tasks that can be automated and require little explainability, we predict that ai will fall short of its promises in many marketing domains if we do not solve the challenges of tacit knowledge transfer between ai models and marketing organizations.\",\"critical success factors influencing artificial intelligence adoption in food supply chains. the adoption of artificial intelligence (ai) in the food supply chains (fsc) can address unique challenges of food safety, quality and wastage by improving transparency and traceability. however, the technology adoption literature in fsc is still the in infancy stage, meaning little is known about the critical success factors (csfs) that could affect the adoption of ai in fsc. therefore, this study makes a pioneering attempt by examining the csfs influencing the adoption of ai in the food supply chain (fsc). a conceptual framework based on toeh (technology\\u2013organisation\\u2013environment\\u2013human) theory is used to determine the csfs influencing ai adoption in the context of indian fsc. the rough-swara technique was used to rank and prioritise the csfs for ai adoption using the relative importance weights. the results of the study indicate that technology readiness, security, privacy, customer satisfaction, perceived benefits, demand volatility, regulatory compliance, competitor pressure and information sharing among partners are the most significant csfs for adopting ai in fsc. the findings of the study would be useful for ai technology providers, supply chain specialists and government agencies in framing appropriate policies to foster the adoption of ai in fsc the sector.\",\"robot adoption and energy performance: evidence from chinese industrial firms. with the continuous development of technology, intelligent production, which brings huge changes to social welfare, has gradually become the main trend in the economic development of many countries. does intelligent production featuring robot adoption help improve the environment and solve energy problems? in this study, we first construct a theoretical model at the micro-level to analyze how robot adoption affects a firm's energy efficiency. then, based on propensity score matching-difference in differences (psm-did) method, we use the data of china's firms from 2001 to 2012 to identify the causal relationship between robot adoption and firm's energy efficiency. we find that the adoption of robots in production can significantly increase firms\\u2019 energy efficiency. further mechanism tests show that the increase of productivity is an important factor through which adopting robots can improve a firm's energy efficiency. in addition, the increase in the firm's energy efficiency is mainly due to the increase in the firm's output rather than the decrease in total energy consumption. altogether, this study provides the first micro evidence on the relationship between robot adoption and energy efficiency, providing significant implications for the world's sustainable development.\",\"understanding artificial intelligence adoption in operations management: insights from the review of academic literature and social media discussions. in this digital era, data is new oil and artificial intelligence (ai) is new electricity, which is needed in different elements of operations management (om) such as manufacturing, product development, services and supply chain. this study explores the feasibility of ai utilization within an organization on six factors such as job-fit, complexity, long-term consequences, affect towards use, social factors and facilitating conditions for different elements of om by mining the collective intelligence of experts on twitter and through academic literature. the study provides guidelines for managers for ai applications in different components of om and concludes by presenting the limitations of the study along with future research directions.\",\"the bright and dark sides of artificial intelligence: a futures perspective on tourist destination experiences. the proliferation of digital technologies has received considerable attention in the business landscape. artificial intelligence (ai) is proclaimed as a transformative technological resource to human experiences, while concrete future scenarios of ai application within contemporary service ecosystems are only little understood. through the theoretical lens of the service-dominant (s-d) logic and a futures methods approach, this study zooms-in on ai as a resource and sheds light on its bright and dark sides. the theoretical and practical contributions of this paper lie in bridging the s-d logic, ai and tourist experience literature. the developed theoretical model, the realms of ai tourist experiences, holistically shows the positive and negative valences of value formation through ai in tourist experiences, and helps organisations prepare and design for the future of ai-facilitated experiences in tourism destinations and wider service contexts.\",\"digital advertising: present and future prospects. new digital technologies have dramatically changed the way firms communicate and interact with consumers via digital media. in this digital era, what does the future of advertising look like? how can scholars enhance research on digital advertising? and how can firms and agencies maximize their return on advertising? this article defines digital advertising by examining what it is\\u2014and will be. we identify key trends relevant to digital advertising, such as a move toward data-driven marketing communication, the impact of artificial intelligence on advertisement production, and the effect of big data on advertisement execution. in the context of these trends, six propositions are posited concerning the management of future digital advertising and the methods and systems for delivering targeted advertisements to consumers. several topics that can be widely applied to digital advertising are proposed for future research.\",\"motion sensing using radar: gesture interaction and beyond. since the debut of ios and android smartphones 10 years ago, the world has seen a mobile era wherein our phones have become a mobile computing platform deeply integrated into our lives [1]-[4]. due to the advancement of computing, it is believed that the world is shifting to a new era where artificial intelligence (ai) is unlocking capabilities that were previously unthinkable [5]-[13]. because computing is becoming more universally available, interaction with computing devices needs to be much more natural, intuitive, and, above all, intelligent [14].\",\"assessing the impact of industrial robots on manufacturing energy intensity in 38 countries. considering the continuing slowdown of the improvement in energy intensity around the world, it is essential to seek a more effective measure to address the dilemma of energy and sustainable development. to this end, this research attempts to provide fresh insight into the determinants of energy intensity from the perspective of industrial robots and an industry-based view. by applying the dynamic panel gmm estimate methodology to a new data panel that includes 38 countries and 17 manufacturing sectors, this study provides the first comprehensive assessment of the use of industrial robots on manufacturing energy intensity. we found that industrial robots could significantly improve manufacturing energy intensity, and our hypotheses passed a series of robustness tests. moreover, this improvement effect works through the technology improvement effect and technological complement effect between industrial robots and labor. finally, we found a heterogeneous nexus exists between industrial robots and manufacturing energy intensity. specifically, industrial robots can exert influence on non-renewable energy intensity rather than renewable energy intensity. compared to capital-intensive sectors, we found that the use of industrial robots mainly affected labor-intensive sectors. we also found that industry 4.0 could promote the improvement effects of industrial robots on manufacturing energy intensity.\",\"the effect of artificial intelligence on carbon intensity: evidence from china's industrial sector. artificial intelligence (ai) is becoming the engine of a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation; as such, it has attracted much attention of scholars in recent years. surprisingly, scarce studies have shed lights on the effects of ai on the environment, especially with respect to carbon intensity. based on the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (stirpat) model, we use chinese industrial sector data from 2005 to 2016 to investigate how ai affects carbon intensity. the empirical results show that ai, as measured separately by the adoption of robotics by industry and the number of academic ai-related papers, significantly reduces carbon intensity. the results remain robust after addressing endogenous issues. we find that there are both stages and industrial heterogeneity in the effects of ai on carbon intensity. ai had a more decrease effect on carbon intensity during the 12th five-year plan than the 11th. compared with capital-intensive industries, ai tends to have a more decrease effect on carbon intensity in the labor-intensive and tech-intensive industries. to enlarge the effects of ai on reducing carbon intensity, the government should promote the development and application of ai and implement differentiated policies in line with the industry characteristics.\",\"hybrid analysis for understanding contact tracing apps adoption. purpose: this study aims to explore the adoption of contact tracing apps through a hybrid analysis of the collected data using structural equation modelling (sem) and artificial neural networks (ann), leading to the identification of the critical determinants for the adoption of contact tracing apps in australia. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a research model is developed within the background of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) and the privacy calculus theory (pct) for investigating the adoption of contact tracing apps. this model is then tested and validated using a hybrid sem-ann analysis of the survey data. findings: the study shows that effort expectancy, perceived value of information disclosure and social influence are critical for adopting contact tracing apps. it reveals that performance expectancy and perceived privacy risks are indirectly significant on the adoption through the influence of perceived value of information disclosure. furthermore, the study finds out that facilitating condition is insignificant to the adoption of contact tracing apps. practical implications: the findings of the study can lead to the formulation of targeted strategies and policies for promoting the adoption of contact tracing apps and inform future epidemic control for better emergency management. originality\\u002fvalue: this study is the first attempt in integrating utaut and pct for exploring the adoption of contact tracing apps in australia. it combines sem and ann for analysing the survey data, leading to better understanding of the critical determinants for the adoption of contact tracing apps.\",\"challenges and opportunities for marketing scholars in times of the fourth industrial revolution. artificial intelligence (ai) and 5g connectivity have been identified as drivers of the so-called fourth industrial revolution (fir). ai and 5g, through emerging technologies such as blockchain, gene editing, internet of things sensors, nanotechnology, or 3d printing accelerate a blurring of boundaries between digital, biological, and physical spheres. in this editorial, we introduce the term boundary object, or boundary technology, that can help process more information (syntactic boundary) for enhanced learning (semantic boundary) and that can create a higher-level intelligence (pragmatic boundary). boundary objects are also a means of representing, learning about, and transforming knowledge at a given boundary. we propose that crossing syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic boundaries is facilitated by three fir phenomena (big data, machine learning, and ai). each of these phenomena possesses a unique capability (processing, learning, and adaptation) to help communities learn about their differences and dependences. we also show how the six articles in this special issue are related to boundary and sphere challenges, and we provide an overview of directions for future research. all in all, marketing scholars should focus on enhancing their abilities in knowledge integration across boundaries to sustain their role as cutting-edge scientists.\",\"big data with cognitive computing: a review for the future. analysis of data by humans can be a time-consuming activity and thus use of sophisticated cognitive systems can be utilized to crunch this enormous amount of data. cognitive computing can be utilized to reduce the shortcomings of the concerns faced during big data analytics. the aim of the study is to provide readers a complete understanding of past, present and future directions in the domain big data and cognitive computing. a systematic literature review has been adopted for this study by using the scopus, dblp and web of science databases. the work done in the field of big data and cognitive computing is currently at the nascent stage and this is evident from the publication record. the characteristics of cognitive computing, namely observation, interpretation, evaluation and decision were mapped to the five v's of big data namely volume, variety, veracity, velocity and value. perspectives which touch all these parameters are yet to be widely explored in existing literature.\",\"smart products: conceptual review, synthesis, and research directions. smart products have received increasing attention from researchers and practitioners alike. one limitation of the existing literature, however, is that the term is often used as a blanket term and that there is no consensus on what a smart product actually is. because different studies rely on differing conceptualizations, the current body of knowledge is scattered and lacks a uniform language and conceptual boundaries. specifically, existing research has subsumed inherently different products under one collective term, has relied on a multitude of ad hoc criteria to define smart products or has conflated smart products with the services they render and\\u002for the wider ecosystem, in which they operate. these developments limit the systematic advancement of the field and impede the integration of the smart product concept into related concepts such as the internet of things. to address these issues, this article provides an extensive analysis of the status quo of the field, with the goal of developing a common language and comprehensive conceptualization of smart products. first, existing studies on smart products were systematically reviewed across contributing disciplines and supplemented with a bibliometric analysis that allowed for a deeper understanding of the smart product concept within and across disciplines. this analysis revealed an initial set of 16 capability-based criteria that are currently applied to conceptualize smart products. second, based on a systematic coding procedure, these criteria were synthesized and organized within a comprehensive framework delineating four distinct product archetypes for the digital age: (1) digital, (2) connected, (3) responsive, and (4) intelligent. third, three major conceptual themes that arise from this framework are identified and possibilities for future research are pointed out. in sum, this work contributes to the literature by improving the understanding of smart products as an epistemic object and by laying the ground for more cumulative research endeavors.\",\"technology adoption decisions in construction organizations. this research examines how managers in contractors' organizations make decisions to adopt a new technology. this paper presents the decision-making processes managers use in the adoption of new technologies, the factors affecting these processes, and the strategies managers use to deal with the uncertainty involved in such decisions. the study focused on eight cases of adoption of two commercially available information technologies: (1) electronic data interchange; and (2) 3d computer-aided design systems. this paper summarizes relevant background, briefly describes the decisions studied, presents the major findings, and highlights practical applications. the recommendations focus on the strategies that managers can use to increase the likelihood of successful adoption of new technologies.\",\"understanding and predicting the motivators of mobile music acceptance - a multi-stage mra-artificial neural network approach. the adoption level of digital music is still at its formative stage although the adoption renders advantageous to consumers. therefore, the study develops a model to predict on the motivation leading to consumer's intention to adopt mobile music services by extending perceived cost (pc), perceived credibility (pcr), social influence (si), and personal innovativeness (inno) with technology acceptance model (tam). 160 respondents were tested using a multi-stage multiple regression analysis (mra) and artificial neural network (ann) approach. a non-linear non-compensatory multi layer perceptron (mlp) ann with feed-forward back-propagation algorithm and ten cross-validation neural networks was deployed in order to capture the motivators of mobile music adoption. all predictor variables were found to have relevance to the output neuron based on the non-zero synaptic weights connected to the hidden neurons. the rmse values indicated that the ann models were able to predict the motivators with very high accuracy. the ann models have out-performed the mra models as they are able to capture the non-linear relationships between the predictor and criterion variables. while the study found that tam is a significant predictor, the insignificance linear relationships of pcr and inno requires further investigation. the music industry can use the findings from this study beneficially to the development of mobile music adoption.\",\"the dark side of ai-powered service interactions: exploring the process of co-destruction from the customer perspective [\\u57fa\\u4e8e\\u4eba\\u5de5\\u667a\\u80fd\\u670d\\u52a1\\u4ea4\\u4e92\\u7684\\u9634\\u6697\\u9762:

human-driven to technology-dominant. as a result, customers are expected to resolve issues themselves before reaching out to customer service representatives, ultimately becoming a central element of service production as co-creators of value. however, ai-powered interactions can also fail, potentially leading to anger, confusion, and customer dissatisfaction. we draw on the value co-creation literature to investigate the process of co-destruction in ai-powered service interactions. we adopt an exploratory approach based on in-depth interviews with 27 customers who have interacted with ai-powered chatbots in customer service settings. we find five antecedents of failed interactions between customers and chatbots: authenticity issues, cognition challenges, affective issues, functionality issues, and integration conflicts. we observe that although customers do accept part of the responsibility for co-destruction, they largely attribute the problems they experience to resource misintegration by service providers. our findings contribute a better understanding of value co-destruction in ai-powered service settings and provide a richer conceptualization of the link between customer resource loss, attributions of resource loss, and subsequent customer coping strategies. our findings also offer service managers insights into how to avoid and mitigate value co-destruction in ai service settings.\",\"attachment and trust in artificial intelligence. lack of trust is one of the main obstacles standing in the way of taking full advantage of the benefits artificial intelligence (ai) has to offer. most research on trust in ai focuses on cognitive ways to boost trust. here, instead, we focus on boosting trust in ai via affective means. specifically, we tested and found associations between one's attachment style\\u2014an individual difference representing the way people feel, think, and behave in relationships\\u2014and trust in ai. in study 1 we found that attachment anxiety predicted less trust. in study 2, we found that enhancing attachment anxiety reduced trust, whereas enhancing attachment security increased trust in ai. in study 3, we found that exposure to attachment security cues (but not positive affect cues) resulted in increased trust as compared with exposure to neutral cues. overall, our findings demonstrate an association between attachment security and trust in ai, and support the ability to increase trust in ai via attachment security priming.\",\"sustainable skills for the world of work in the digital age. the skills that small and medium-sized enterprises will need in the near future are an essential research topic that has not yet been appropriately addressed. the current paper aims to fill this gap in the literature. explicitly, the study aimed to identify the critical skills for organizations and the disruptive technological skills. to this end, a literature review was conducted, and an online survey explored the main critical skills for the future and the disruptive technological skills contributing to achieving sustainable employability. the critical skills identified in the study were complex problem-solving, critical thinking, creativity, people management, coordinating with others, emotional intelligence, judgement and decision making, service orientation and negotiating and cognitive flexibility. as for the disruptive technological skills, these were artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, robotization, internet of things, augmented reality and digitalization. findings may assist companies to develop the skills needed to respond to the challenges of a continuously changing business environment.\",\"robots in the workplace: a threat to\\u2014or opportunity for\\u2014meaningful work?. the concept of meaningful work has recently received increased attention in philosophy and other disciplines. however, the impact of the increasing robotization of the workplace on meaningful work has received very little attention so far. doing work that is meaningful leads to higher job satisfaction and increased worker well-being, and some argue for a right to access to meaningful work. in this paper, we therefore address the impact of robotization on meaningful work. we do so by identifying five key aspects of meaningful work: pursuing a purpose, social relationships, exercising skills and self-development, self-esteem and recognition, and autonomy. for each aspect, we analyze how the introduction of robots into the workplace may diminish or enhance the meaningfulness of work. we also identify a few ethical issues that emerge from our analysis. we conclude that robotization of the workplace can have both significant negative and positive effects on meaningful work. our findings about ways in which robotization of the workplace can be a threat or opportunity for meaningful work can serve as the basis for ethical arguments for how to\\u2014and how not to\\u2014implement robots into workplaces.\",\"learning machine learning with very young children: who is teaching whom?. while artificial intelligence and machine learning is becoming a commonplace feature of people's everyday lives, so far few theoretical or empirical studies have focused on investigating it in k-12\\u200b education. drawing on the sociocultural theory of learning and participation, this case study explored how six very young children taught and explored google's teachable machine in nonschool settings. through fine-grained analysis of video recordings and interviews with the children, the article illustrates the content and the process of teaching where 3\\u20139 year old children were producing machine learning data sets and models as well as observing, exploring, and explaining their own interaction with machine learning systems. the results illustrate the quick-paced and embodied nature of the child-computer interaction that also supported children to reason about the relationship between their own bodily expressions and the output of an interactive ml-based tool. the article concludes with discussions on the emergent process of teaching and learning as well as on ways of promoting children's participation and sense of agency in the age of machine learning.\",\"application of virtual reality in computer science education: a systemic review based on bibliometric and content analysis methods. this study investigated the role of virtual reality (vr) in computer science (cs) education over the last 10 years by conducting a bibliometric and content analysis of articles related to the use of vr in cs education. a total of 971 articles published in peer-reviewed journals and conferences were collected from web of science and scopus databases to conduct the bibliometric analysis. furthermore, content analysis was conducted on 39 articles that met the inclusion criteria. this study demonstrates that vr research for cs education was faring well around 2011 but witnessed low production output between the years 2013 and 2016. however, scholars have increased their contribution in this field recently, starting from the year 2017. this study also revealed prolific scholars contributing to the field. it provides insightful information regarding research hotspots in vr that have emerged recently, which can be further explored to enhance cs education. in addition, the quantitative method remains the most preferred research method, while the questionnaire was the most used data collection technique. moreover, descriptive analysis was primarily used in studies on vr in cs education. the study concludes that even though scholars are leveraging vr to advance cs education, more effort needs to be made by stakeholders across countries and institutions. in addition, a more rigorous methodological approach needs to be employed in future studies to provide more evidence-based research output. our future study would investigate the pedagogy, content, and context of studies on vr in cs education.\",\"service research priorities: managing and delivering service in turbulent times. transformative changes in the societal and service context call out for the service discipline to develop a coherent set of priorities for research and practice. to this end, we utilized multiple data sources: surveys of

the unsustainability of the sociotechnical system. artificial intelligence (ai) is associated with both positive and negative impacts on both people and planet, and much attention is currently devoted to analyzing and evaluating these impacts. in 2015, the un set 17 sustainable development goals (sdgs), consisting of environmental, social, and economic goals. this article shows how the sdgs provide a novel and useful framework for analyzing and categorizing the benefits and harms of ai. ai is here considered in context as part of a sociotechnical system consisting of larger structures and economic and political systems, rather than as a simple tool that can be analyzed in isolation. this article distinguishes between direct and indirect effects of ai and divides the sdgs into five groups based on the kinds of impact ai has on them. while ai has great positive potential, it is also intimately linked to nonuniversal access to increasingly large data sets and the computing infrastructure required to make use of them. as a handful of nations and companies control the development and application of ai, this raises important questions regarding the potential negative implications of ai on the sdgs. the conceptual framework here presented helps structure the analysis of which of the sdgs ai might be useful in attaining and which goals are threatened by the increased use of ai.\",\"artificial intelligence for supply chain resilience: learning from covid-19. purpose: many supply chains have faced disruption during covid-19. artificial intelligence (ai) is

large digital platform. artificial intelligence (ai) is surpassing human performance in a growing number of domains. however, there is limited evidence of its economic effects. using data from a digital platform, we study a key application of ai: machine translation. we find that the introduction of a new machine translation system has significantly increased international trade on this platform, increasing exports by 10.9%. furthermore, heterogeneous treatment effects are consistent with a substantial reduction in translation costs. our results provide causal evidence that language barriers significantly hinder trade and that ai has already begun to improve economic efficiency in at least one domain.\",\"factors affecting mobile payment adoption intention: an indian perspective. this study aims to identify the factors affecting mobile payment (m-payment) adoption intention in india by proposing a conceptual framework based on technology acceptance model (tam). in addition to construct of tam, four user-centric constructs have been added to evaluate m-payment adoption intention in india. the proposed research framework was empirically tested by data collected from 381 potential m-payment service users, through online and offline survey. data were analysed using structural equation modelling (sem) technique. the results exhibit that perceived ease of use (peou), perceived usefulness (pu), trust, and self-efficacy (se) have a significant positive impact on m-payment adoption intention. however, subjective norms (sn) and personal innovativeness (pi) have no significant impact on m-payment adoption intention. findings of the study have important theoretical and practical implications, particularly to understand important user-centric factors affecting m-payment adoption.\",\"comparing fingerprint-based biometrics authentication versus traditional authentication methods for e-payment. biometrics authentication for electronic payment is generally viewed as a quicker, convenient and a more secure means to identify and authenticate users for online payment. this view is mostly anecdotal and conceptual is nature. the aim of the paper is to shed light on the comparison of perceptions and beliefs of different authentication methods for electronic payment (i.e., credit card, credit card with pin, and fingerprint biometrics authentication) in an e-commerce context. as theoretical foundation, the valence framework is used in understanding and explaining the individual's evaluation of benefit and risk concerning the payment methods. we propose a research model with hypotheses that evaluate and compare the individual's perceptions of the payment authentication methods, trust of the online store, and the willingness to continue using the website account associated with the payment authentication method. an experiment is used to test the hypotheses. the results show that biometrics authentication significantly influences the individual's security concern, perceived usefulness, and trust of online store. theoretically, through the study's context \\u2013 biometrics versus credit card authentication \\u2013 evidence is provided for the importance of the individual's perceptions, concerns, and beliefs in the use of biometrics for electronic payments. managerial implications include shedding light on the perceptions

research on track with business reality?. purpose: service technologies are transforming the business landscape rapidly. this paper aims to explore the current scope of research in regard to emerging service technologies by comparing the content of articles in academic journals with practitioner-oriented publication outlets. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a total of 5,118 technology-related articles from service journals, service conferences, business journals and business magazines are analyzed. text-mining on abstracts is used for the thematic and semantic analysis. common research themes and their relationships are depicted in a two-dimensional structured network. further, the sample is analyzed regarding various technologies mentioned in the gartner hype cycle. findings: the paper reveals differences in academic and business perspectives in regard to service technologies. in comparison to business journals, scientific service research is more focused on customer-related aspects of technology. service research has a less concrete focus on technology than in business publications. still, service conference articles show a broader scope of emerging service technologies than academic journal articles. research limitations\\u002fimplications: scientific research should focus on more concrete service technologies. business magazines serve as a good source for that and the paper identifies several promising new technology fields. practical implications: although business magazines cover significantly more concrete service technologies, they miss

assistants is affected by their value perceptions. this research also examines whether social anxiety moderates the relationship between ai assistant advantages and utilitarian\\u002fhedonic value. the study reveals that ai assistant advantages are important factors affecting the utilitarian\\u002fhedonic value perceived by users, which further influence user willingness to accept ai assistants. the relationships between ai assistant advantages and utilitarian and hedonic value are affected differently by social anxiety. marketers and managers in the ai context can refer to the study methods to help improve ai assistants and develop more effective marketing strategies for product promotion.\",\"artificial intelligence in marketing: systematic review and future research direction. disruptive technologies such as the internet of things, big data analytics, blockchain, and artificial intelligence have changed the ways businesses operate. of all the disruptive technologies, artificial intelligence (ai) is the latest technological disruptor and holds immense marketing transformation potential. practitioners worldwide are trying to figure out the best fit ai solutions for their marketing functions. however, a systematic literature review can highlight the importance of artificial intelligence (ai) in marketing and chart future research directions. the present study aims to offer a comprehensive review of ai in marketing using bibliometric, conceptual and intellectual network analysis of extant literature published between 1982 and 2020. a comprehensive review of one thousand five hundred and eighty papers helped to identify the scientific actors' performance like most relevant authors and most relevant sources. furthermore, co-citation and co-occurrence analysis offered the conceptual and intellectual network. data clustering using the louvain algorithm helped identify research sub-themes and future research directions to expand ai in marketing.\",\"does technological innovation bring destruction or creation to the labor market?. the latest era of the industrial revolution is the culmination of an accelerating pace of evolution and digital transformation, one that has had a profound impact on the labor market dynamics. the bootstrap rolling-window causality test has been referred to analyze this, in further detail. this approach has been undertaken to start triggering a discourse on the employment benefits of technological innovation and actively respond to the challenges associated with technological progress in the labor market. by studying the interactions between the number of patents (pis) and the new employment (ne) opportunities during 2013:m01-2021:m8, we have found that the interaction mechanism between innovation and employment is complicated. in this regard, the positive impact can confirm that technological innovation has given a boost to the labor market. however, this view can also be refuted by the negative influences surrounding the concept, primarily because the substitution effect of employment tends to be greater than the creation effect. therefore, the ne negatively impacts the pis, indicating that the labor market can be a leading indicator for innovation and development. it should be noted that chinese society has been in a period of digital transformation for some time now, and the impact of short-term employment also contains new impetus.\",\"how artificial intelligence will change the future of marketing. in the future, artificial intelligence (ai) is likely to substantially change both marketing strategies and customer behaviors. building from not only extant research but also extensive interactions with practice, the authors propose a multidimensional framework for understanding the impact of ai involving intelligence levels, task types, and whether ai is embedded in a robot. prior research typically addresses a subset of these dimensions; this paper integrates all three into a single framework. next, the authors propose a research agenda that addresses not only how marketing strategies and customer behaviors will change in the future, but also highlights important policy questions relating to privacy, bias and ethics. finally, the authors suggest ai will be more effective if it augments (rather than replaces) human managers.\",\"robots and organization studies: why robots might not want to steal your job. a number of recent high-profile studies of robotics and artificial intelligence (or ai) in economics and sociology have predicted that many jobs will soon disappear due to automation, with few new ones replacing them. while techno-optimists and techno-pessimists contest whether a jobless future is a positive development or not, this paper points to the elephant in the room. despite successive waves of computerization (including advanced machine learning), jobs have not disappeared. and probably won\\u2019t in the near future. to explain why, some basic insights from organization studies can make a contribution. i propose the concept of \\u2018bounded automation\\u2019 to demonstrate how organizational forces mould the application of technology in the employment sector. if work does not vanish in the age of ai, then poorly paid jobs will most certainly proliferate, i argue. finally, a case is made for the scholarly community to engage with wider social justice concerns. this i term public organization studies.\",\"artificially intelligent device use in service delivery: a systematic review, synthesis, and research agenda. this study undertakes a systematic review of artificial intelligence and its applications to service encounters and the hospitality industry by reviewing publications that (1) mainly discuss ai technology, (2) are in the context of services, and (3) investigate the use or the adoption of ai technology rather than technical issues such as system design, algorithms, voice recognition modules, or psychological knowledge representations. seven major themes are identified via a review of 63 publications. the themes are (1) current ai technology in service frontline, (2) levels of artificial intelligence, (3) ai agents, (4) human\\u2013ai service encounters, (5) theoretical frameworks of the acceptance of ai, (6) reasons for adopting ai, and (7) potential challenges of ai. this study also offers a further research agenda that highlights nine critical research areas to guide human\\u2013ai interaction and ai adoption researches.\",\"exploring the challenges of remote work on twitter users' sentiments: from digital technology development to a post-pandemic era. the boost in the use and development of technology, spurred by covid-19 pandemic and its consequences, has sped up the adoption of new technologies and digital platforms in companies. specifically, companies have been forced to change their organizational and work structures. in this context, the present study aims to identify the main opportunities and challenges for remote work through the use of digital technologies and platforms based on the analysis of user-generated content (ugc) in twitter. using computer-aided text analysis (cata) and natural language processing (nlp), in this study, we conduct a sentiment analysis developed with textblob, which works with machine learning. we then apply a mathematical algorithm for topic modeling known as latent dirichlet allocation (lda) model. based on the results obtained from these data-mining techniques, we identify 11 topics, of which 3 are negative (virtual health, privacy concerns and stress), 4 positive (work-life balance, less stress, future and engagement), and 3 neutral (new technologies, sustainability, and technology issues). in addition, we also identify and discussed 6 opportunities and 5 challenges in relation to the use and adoption of digital technologies and platforms for teleworking. finally, theoretical and practical implications of the study are presented for companies that develop strategies based on teleworking and the adoption of new technologies in which stress management is configured as one of the most relevant indicators for further research on remote work. from the applied perspective, executives and policymakers can use the results of the present study to re-evaluate the benefits of remote work for employees.\",\"the robot revolution: managerial and employment consequences for firms. as a new general-purpose technology, robots have the potential to radically transform employment and organizations. in contrast to prior studies that predict dramatic employment declines, we find that investments in robotics are associated with increases in total firm employment but decreases in the total number of managers. similarly, we find that robots are associated with an increase in the span of control for supervisors remaining within the organization. we also provide evidence that robot adoption is not motivated by the desire to reduce labor costs but is instead related to improving product and service quality. our findings are consistent with the notion that robots reduce variance in production processes, diminishing the need for managers to monitor worker activities to ensure production quality. as additional evidence, we also find that robot investments predict improved performance measurement and increased adoption of incentive pay based on individual employee performance. with respect to changes in skill composition within the organization, robots predict decreases in employment for middle-skilled workers but increases in employment for low- and high-skilled workers. we also find that robots predict not only changes in employment but also corresponding adaptations in organizational structure. robot investments are associated with both centralization and decentralization of decision-making authority depending on the task, but decision rights in either case are reassigned away from the managerial level of the hierarchy. overall, our results suggest that robots have distinct and profound effects on employment and organizations that require fundamental changes in firm practices and organizational design.\",\"improved rrt-connect algorithm based on triangular inequality for robot path planning. this paper proposed a triangular inequality-based rewiring method for the rapidly exploring random tree (rrt)-connect robot path-planning algorithm that guarantees the planning time compared to the rrt algorithm, to bring it closer to the optimum. to check the proposed algorithm\\u2019s performance, this paper compared the rrt and rrt-connect algorithms in various environments through simulation. from these experimental results, the proposed algorithm shows both quicker planning time and shorter path length than the rrt algorithm and shorter path length than the rrt-connect algorithm with a similar number of samples and planning time.\",\"predictors for e-government adoption: integrating tam, tpb, trust and perceived risk. purpose - the present research aims to identify determinants for citizen' behavioural adoption of e-government, explore relationships among these variables and investigate whether the proposed model can provide a more comprehensive manner to understand the adoption of e-government. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach - first, a survey is administered to collect data, then the cronbach's alpha is assessed for internal consistency of measurement scales; second, confirmatory factor analysis is conducted to evaluate the measurement model; finally, a structural equation model is used to test the proposed hypotheses and explore the determinants of e-government adoption. findings - results indicate that the proposed model is a stable model with powerful explanatory of variation. in addition, some new relationships in the e-government context are found, whose disposition to trust has positive effect on social norms, whereas perceived risk negatively influences perceived behaviour control. moreover, other key dominants have been investigated. originality\\u002fvalue - the findings have enabled us to better understand factors affecting intention and also provided a solid theoretical research model for future study.\",\"digitalization, routineness and employment: an exploration on italian task-based data. this paper explores the relation between the digitalization of labour processes, the level of routineness of labour tasks and changes in employment in the case of italy in the period 2011-16. the levels of digitalization and routineness of occupations in more than 500 4-digit isco professional groups are measured using data from a unique italian profession-level survey on skill, tasks and work contents \\u2013 the inapp-istat survey on italian occupations (icp), an o*net-type dataset. two digitalization indices are used: a digital use index, measuring the use of computers and e-mail in the workplace, and a digital tasks index, capturing the presence of a set of key digital tasks, such as those related to programming or activities concerning the use of specialized hardware. the same dataset is used to compute a composite routine task intensity index. the descriptive evidence presented in the paper shows strong differences across occupations in the level of digitalization and routineness, and the presence of a negative relation between the two in most professional groups. the econometric estimates show that digital-intensive occupations tend to grow more than the rest of the workforce, particularly when digitalization is measured relying on the digital use indicator. the level of routineness, in turn, is negatively or, in some specifications, not significantly associated to employment change. however, occupations that are both digital and routine-intensive turn out to be penalized in terms of employment growth, providing further support to (and further qualifying) the the routine biased technological change (rbtc) hypothesis. in other words, our results show that the impact of digitalization on employment is mediated by the level of routineness characterizing the tasks bundled in each occupation.\",\"exploring the impact of chatbots on consumer sentiment and expectations in retail. retailers are increasingly using conversational ai (chatbots) for customer service due to the perceived benefits and reduced operational costs of this emerging technology. yet our understanding of how consumers perceive interactions with chatbots, and how these interactions may influence other consumer service programs, remains limited. this paper investigates the differences in consumers' sentiments towards chatbots across retail sectors, and the influence chatbots have on consumers\\u2019 sentiments and expectations towards other service interactions with online human agents. using a hybrid automated sentiment analysis approach, we identify that (1) overall sentiment towards bots are less negative than sentiment towards online human agents; (2) these sentiments differ across fashion and telecommunications sectors, and finally (3) sentiments towards online human agents in both sectors become more negative after a retailer implements a chatbot.\",\"the evolution and prospects of service-dominant logic: an investigation of past, present, and future research. service-dominant logic (sdl) emerged over a decade ago as a potential framework and paradigmatic lens for rethinking the role of service in exchange and value creation. the growth of sdl reflects a major shift in service research. however, sdl\\u2019s relationship to prior service literature and its potential for future development in this field have not been empirically examined. we explore the foundational research areas and evolution of sdl research through a systematic investigation, which combines cocitation analysis with a novel text mining tool, leximancer. specifically, we investigate the research streams connected with sdl and compare core themes across two time periods (2004 to 2008 vs. 2009 to 2015). the findings reveal sdl\\u2019s interdisciplinary theoretical heritage and significant changes in the structure of focal themes and concepts over time. our analyses identify current limitations and subsequent research areas and questions to further develop strategic approaches for sdl and advance a service ecosystems view. these include open innovation, dynamic capabilities, organizational microfoundations, and service systems, as well as social capital and consumer culture theories. integration of midrange theories and strategic frameworks in these particular areas can help to guide managers in improving service innovation and enhancing value creation in service ecosystems.\",\"immersive netnography: a novel method for service experience research in virtual reality, augmented reality and metaverse contexts. purpose: as immersive technologies gain wider adoption, contemporary service researchers are tasked with studying their service experiences in ways that preserve and attend to their holistic and human characteristics. the purpose of this paper is to provide service researchers with a new qualitative approach to studying immersive technologies. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: using logic and following established methodological rules, this article develops the scope, definition and set of procedures for a novel form of netnography specifically adapted for the study of immersive technologies: immersive netnography. the research question is \\u201chow might netnography be adapted to research service experiences in virtual and augmented environments, which include and overlap with the notion of a metaverse?\\u201d findings: immersive netnography should be at the vanguard of phenomenological service experience studies of augmented reality, virtual reality and the metaverse. a set of data collection, analysis, ethical and representational research practices, immersive netnography is adapted to digital media phenomena (customer and employee) that include immersive technology experiences. developed through logical argumentation after analyzing key differences between social media and immersive technology, immersive netnography is procedurally customized for experience research in immersive technology environments. research limitations\\u002fimplications: three of the most significant practical limitations to producing high-quality netnography are rapidly changing contexts, scarce time resources and narrow researcher skillsets. practical implications: industries and organizations may benefit from a new, holistically focused, ethically robust and culturally attuned market research method for understanding service experience in immersive technology contexts. originality\\u002fvalue: there have been no prior studies that develop netnography for the service research opportunities presented by immersive technologies. by applying the rigorous methodological guidance provided in this paper, future service researchers may find value in using specifically adapted qualitative research methods to study immersive technology experiences.\",\"ai-based self-service technology in public service delivery: user experience and influencing factors. public sectors are utilizing ai-based self-service technology (sst) at an accelerating rate, given its potential for improving work efficiency and user experience, reducing service costs, and relieving human workloads. however, there is a limited understanding of the factors influencing citizens' user experience when services supported by ai-based sst are provided. thus, with insights from the consumer value theory, this paper aims to explore the factors that are important to ai-based sst user experience and the conditional role of trust in government. the on-site survey of 379 citizens in a public service center in china indicates that user experience positively relates to personalization and aesthetics and negatively associates with perceived time spent on the ai-based self-service machines. in addition, the results suggest that citizens with more trust in government are more likely to have a pleasant experience coming from ai-based sst's personalization and aesthetics. public managers should ensure that the ai-based sst is aesthetically appealing and should be able to personalize the delivery of the right contents to the right person at the right time. furthermore, they should always prioritize cultivating more trust from citizens to achieve a more positive user experience.\",\"big data commercialization. we consider the emerging trade in big data through commercial transactions. through a wide ranging systematic literature review that covers both academic and practitioner perspectives, we first demonstrate that there is increasing interest in big data commercialization, which mostly consists of exploratory theoretical development and managerial prescriptions to date. we outline the new types of businesses that seek to create and appropriate value, including the data supplier, data manager, data custodian, data aggregator, application developer and service provider. building upon this typology, we discuss the processes of business model emergence, and the importance of data ecosystems, reviewing both ecosystem structure and dynamics. we also highlight the challenges for the trade in big data, including ip protection, regulatory complexity, pricing, the development of data agreements and privacy

new mechanism for individuals to watch television programs via mobile device, known as mobile television (m-tv). considering that m-tv is an emerging technology among traditional television services where critical success factors depend on user-centered, it is important to understand users' behavioral intention (bi). unlike previous studies which have mainly focused on flow experience, perceived value, motivation and social cognitive theories, this study examines user-centered factors of technology readiness (tr) and technical support and training (tst). therefore, 244 valid data were tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (pls-sem) to measure both reflective and formative constructs based on the proposed framework. findings reported that performance expectancy (pe), effort expectancy (ee) and tst have a positive and significant impact on bi. tr however has a negative relationship with bi. in addition, tr was also found to influence pe and ee. similarly, tst has a direct effect factor on ee and ee was a significant determinant of pe. the findings of this study not only provide guidance for future researchers, but also valuable insights for designers, marketers and system providers of m-tv to tailor their services in the near future.\",\"a global exploration of big data in the supply chain: global exploration of big data. purposejournals in business logistics, operations management, supply chain management, and business strategy have initiated ongoing calls for big data research and its impact on research and practice. currently, no extant research has defined the concept fully. the purpose of this paper is to develop an industry grounded definition of big data by canvassing supply chain managers across six nations. the supply chain setting defines big data as inclusive of four dimensions: volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. the study further extracts multiple concepts that are important to the future of supply chain relationship strategy and performance. these outcomes provide a starting point and extend a call for theoretically grounded and paradigm-breaking research on managing business-to-business

in managing supply chain and logistics relationships. originality\\u002fvaluethere is currently no central grounding of the term, dimensions, and issues related to big data in supply chain research. for the first time, the authors address subjects related to how supply chain partners employ big data across the supply chain, uncover big data\\u2019s potential to influence supply chain performance, and detail the obstacles to developing big data\\u2019s potential. in addition, the study introduces the native category qualitative interview approach to scmls researchers.\",\"the role of capabilities in shaping sustainable supply chain flexibility and enhancing circular economy-target performance: an empirical study. purpose: a circular economy is a popular approach considered by many firms to address sustainable development goals strategically. literature indicates that collaborative relationships among supply chain partners facilitate circular economy practices. however, there is a dearth of studies in lower-middle-income countries indicating the unique challenges industries face whilst practising circular economy principles and how the challenges can be overcome. to address the calls of previous researchers, this study aims to explore the following relationships: engagement and alliance capability whilst data analytics capability plays a mediating role; the relationship between alliance and data analytics capability with sustainable supply chain flexibility whilst industry dynamism is considered as a moderating variable and the relationship between sustainable supply chain flexibility and circular economy-target performance. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a cross-sectional survey was performed and data was collected from 760 employees of indian firms. covariance-based structural equation modelling was applied to perform the path analysis to determine a firm\\u2019s capabilities in shaping sustainable supply chain flexibility and enhancing circular economy target performance. findings: drawing upon dynamic capability theory, it was first established that engagement capability has a positive and significant influence on alliance capability, whilst data analytics capability played a partial mediating role. second, it was established that alliance capability and data analytics capability significantly affect sustainable supply chain flexibility, whilst industry dynamism played a moderating role. finally, it was clear that sustainable supply chain flexibility had a significant and positive effect on circular economy target performance, ultimately enhancing sustainability. originality\\u002fvalue: this study advances the circular economy literature by recommending that firms must consider some critical operational level capabilities to develop their dynamic capability, i.e. sustainable supply chain flexibility, to better meet the competitive market conditions in turbulent business environments.\",\"a review of

framework.\",\"digital servitization value co-creation framework for ai services: a research agenda for digital transformation in financial service ecosystems. purpose: innovative firms have rapidly developed artificial intelligence (ai) capabilities into their service ecosystems, essentially changing perceptions of what is service quality and service delivery in their respective industries. nonetheless, the issues surrounding ai services remain relatively unknown. the purpose for this paper is to offer a digital servitization framework for understanding how ai services impact value perceptions, consumer engagement and firm performance measures. the authors use the financial service ecosystem to explore this topic. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the authors explore relevant literature on digital servitization, service-dominant logic and ai\\u002fdisruptive innovation. next, a conceptual framework, organized by ai-service exchange antecedents, context of ai usage and digital servitization consequences, is developed. the authors conceptualize consequences for consumers and firms. findings: the main findings suggest that the linkages between consumers, financial institutions and fintech companies with ai usage in a service ecosystem should be identified; how value is created among multiple sd logic-ai network actors should be analyzed; and the effects of ai-consumer interactions (lower-level and higher levels of engagement) on firm performance measures should be explored. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the conceptual framework identifies gaps in the literature and suggests research questions for future studies. practical implications: this paper may assist practitioners with the development of ai-enabled banking activities that involve direct consumer engagement. originality\\u002fvalue: to the authors\\u2019 best knowledge, this research agenda is the first comprehensive framework for understanding value co-creation in the

in healthcare technology products. purpose: the purpose of the study is to investigate critical factors affecting individuals\\u2019 intention to adopt internet of things (iot) products in healthcare. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: an integrated model was developed based on technology acceptance model (tam), innovation diffusion theory (idt), technological innovativeness (ti), protection motivation theory and privacy calculus theory. the model was tested with 426 respondents (222 females, 204 males) using partial least square structural equation model with all data grouped by gender. findings: based on the results of the complete model, perceived advantage (pa), image and perceived ease of use (peou) constructs have a significant effect on intention to adopt iot healthcare technology products. the results show that for females, compatibility and trialability have more impact on peou whereas for males pa has more impact on peou. image, perceived privacy risk, perceived vulnerability have more impact on males when compared to females. research limitations\\u002fimplications: research conducted only among turkish people. originality\\u002fvalue: this study investigated adoption of future technology, \\u201cinternet of things\\u201d, products in healthcare from a behavioral perspective by integrating various theories. the reason is that before launching

marketing. purpose: this paper aims to examine how consumers respond to social media influencers that are created through artificial intelligence (ai) and compares effects to traditional (human) influencers. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: across two empirical studies, the authors examine the efficacy of ai social media influencers. with study 1, the authors establish baseline effects for ai influencers and investigate how social-psychological distance impacts consumer perceptions. the authors also investigate the role of an influencer\\u2019s agency \\u2013 being autonomous or externally managed \\u2013 to test the boundaries of the results and determine the interactive effects between influencer type and influencer agency. study 2 acts as an extension and validation of study 1, whereby the authors provide generalisability and overlay the role of need for uniqueness as a moderated mediator. findings: the authors show that there are similarities and differences in the ways in which consumers view ai and human influencers. importantly, the authors find no difference in terms of intention to follow or personalisation. this suggests that consumers are equally open to follow an ai or human influencer, and they perceive the level of personalisation provided by either influencer type as similar. furthermore, while an ai influencer is generally perceived as having lower source trust, they are more likely to evoke word-of-mouth intentions. in understanding these effects, the authors show that social distance mediates the relationship between influencer type and the outcomes the authors investigate. results also show that ai influencers can have a greater effect on consumers who have a high need for uniqueness. finally, the authors find that a lack of influencer agency has a detrimental effect. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the studies investigate consumers\\u2019 general response to ai influencers within the context of instagram, however, future research might examine consumers\\u2019 response to posts promoting specific products across a variety of category contexts and within different social media platforms. practical implications: the authors find that in some ways, an ai influencer can be as effective as a human influencer. indeed, the authors suggest that there may be a spill-over effect from consumer experiences with other ai recommendation systems, meaning that consumers are open to ai influencer recommendations. however, the authors find consistent evidence that ai influencers are trusted less than traditional influencers, hence the authors caution brands from rushing to replace human influencers with their ai counterparts. originality\\u002fvalue: this paper offers novel insight into the increasingly prominent phenomenon of the ai influencer. specifically, it takes initial steps towards developing understanding as to how consumers respond to ai influencers and contrast these effects with human influencers.\",\"a note on the growth of research in service operations management. we present an empirical assessment of the productivity of individuals and institutions in terms of

the results indicate that som research has been growing and key contributions are being made by an array of researchers and institutions.\",\"human trust in artificial intelligence: review of empirical research. artificial intelligence (ai) characterizes a new generation of technologies capable of interacting with the environment and aiming to simulate human intelligence. the suc-cess of integrating ai into organizations critically depends on workers\\u2019 trust in ai technology. this review explains how ai differs from other technologies and presents the existing empirical research on the determinants of human \\u201ctrust\\u201d in ai, conducted in multiple disciplines over the last 20 years. based on the reviewed literature, we identify the form of ai representation (robot, virtual, and embedded) and its level of machine intelligence (i.e., its capabilities) as important antecedents to the development of trust and propose a framework that addresses the elements that shape users\\u2019 cognitive and emotional trust. our review reveals the important role of ai\\u2019s tangibility, transparency, reliability, and immediacy behaviors in developing cognitive trust, and the role of ai\\u2019s anthropomorphism specifically for emotional trust. we also note several limitations in the current evidence base, such as the diversity of trust measures and overreliance on short-term, small sample, and experimental studies, where the development of trust is likely to be different than in longer-term, higher stakes field environments. based on our review, we suggest the most promising paths for future research.\",\"why do people use and recommend m-wallets?. in recent years, mobile wallets (m-wallets), a special form of mobile payment, have garnered much attention in various emerging markets. m-wallets were designed to offer customers swiftness, ease of use, efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, and accessibility. despite these benefits, usage intentions and adoption of m-wallets in most emerging markets have been low, and they have not received widespread acceptance. notably, existing research related to intentions to use (ius) mobile payments has largely focused on developed economies and mobile payments in general. additionally, few studies have examined intentions to recommend (itrs), even though researchers have recognized that word-of-mouth is an important driver of consumer behavior. in the present study, we addressed the lack of specific findings on use and recommendation intentions in the context of m-wallets by conducting a large cross-sectional survey of 1256 smartphone users based on diffusion of innovation theory (doi). results revealed that relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, and observability were significantly associated with participants' intentions toward m-wallets. however, trialability had no association with participants\\u2019 intentions to use and recommend m-wallets to

inevitable in hospitality companies; thus, how ai service recovery retains customers is an issue that cannot be ignored. this article focuses on ai service recovery, abandoning the traditional \\u201cintelligence quotient\\u201d thinking and exploring the recovery effect of empathy response from the perspective of emotional intelligence. using four experimental scenarios, the results indicate that, in service recovery, a high-empathy ai response can increase customers\\u2019 continuous usage intention, and psychological distance and trust are sequential mediators in this process. compared with mono-sensory stimulus interactions (text only), a high-empathy response that adopts multisensory stimulus interactions (text and voice) could strengthen the recovery effect of empathy responses. this paper extends the field of ai service research from a focus on time and phase to the continuing use of ai after service failure. it also moves beyond the traditional intelligence quotient improvement thinking and reveals the importance of using ai emotional intelligence to activate customer emotional response in ai service recovery. finally, it provides a useful tool for resolving ai service failure problems autonomously in the service process, which is of great value to research and development and hospitality operators in the promotion and application of ai services.\",\"a strategic framework for artificial intelligence in marketing. the authors develop a three-stage framework for strategic marketing planning, incorporating multiple artificial intelligence (ai) benefits: mechanical ai for automating repetitive marketing functions and activities, thinking ai for processing data to arrive at decisions, and feeling ai for analyzing interactions and human emotions. this framework lays out the ways that ai can be used for marketing research, strategy (segmentation, targeting, and positioning, stp), and actions. at the marketing research stage, mechanical ai can be used for data collection, thinking ai for market analysis, and feeling ai for customer understanding. at the marketing strategy (stp) stage, mechanical ai can be used for segmentation (segment recognition), thinking ai for targeting (segment recommendation), and feeling ai for positioning (segment resonance). at the marketing action stage, mechanical ai can be used for standardization, thinking ai for personalization, and feeling ai for relationalization. we apply this framework to various areas of marketing, organized by marketing 4ps\\u002f4cs, to illustrate the strategic use of ai.\",\"technology opportunity discovery (tod) from existing technologies and products: a function-based tod framework. research into deriving technology opportunities from existing technologies or products (etps) is useful to technology-based firms, which have to expand their technology portfolios with limited resources. therefore, this study proposes a function-based framework for technology opportunity discovery (tod) from a firm's etps. this framework consists of: (1) a tod knowledge base that structures information on products, technologies, and their functions, which has been extracted from 223,603 patents in various technical fields, and (2) a tod logic that derives potential technology opportunities from an etp using semantic functional similarities between technologies or products. this framework returns technology opportunities in terms of the four types of tod paths: existing technology (et) to technologies that can be developed by modifying et, et to products that can be produced by using et, existing product (ep) to products that can be developed by modifying ep, and ep to technologies that can be adopted to improve ep. we implement the proposed framework in a prototype system, and demonstrate tod cases, using several etps. this framework will contribute to creating systematic tod based on current technological capability over a wide range of technologies, and become a basis for developing future automated technology intelligence systems.\",\"the role of human\\u2013machine interactive devices for post-covid-19 innovative sustainable tourism in ho chi minh city, vietnam. in this research article, we aim to study the proposed role of human\\u2013machine interactive (hmi) technologies, including both artificial intelligence (ai) and virtual reality (vr)-enabled applications, for the post-covid-19 revival of the already depleted tourism industry in vietnam\\u2019s major tourist destination and business hub of ho chi minh city. the researchers aim to gather practical knowledge regarding tourists\\u2019 intentions for such service enhancements, which may drive the sector to adopt a better conclusive growth pattern in post-covid-19 times. in this study, we attempt to focus on travelers who look for paramount safety with the assurance of empathetic, personalized care in post-covid-19 times. in the current study, the authors employ structural equation modeling to evaluate the intentions of tourists both structurally and empirically for destination tourism with data collected from tourists with previous exposure to various kinds of these devices. the study shows that human\\u2013machine interactive devices are integrating ai and vr and have a significant effect on overall service quality, leading to tourist satisfaction and loyalty. the use of such social interactive gadgets within tourism and mostly in hospitality services requires an organization to make a commitment to futuristic technologies, along with building value by enriching service quality expectations among fearful tourists. this research shows that tourists mainly focus on the use of such hmi devices from the perspective of technology acceptance factors, qualitative value-enhancing service and trustworthy information-sharing mechanisms. the concept of the tour bubble framework is also discussed in detail. the analysis of this discussion gives us a more profound understanding of the novel opportunities which various administrative agencies may benefit from to position these devices better in smart, sustainable destination tourism strategies for the future so that, collectively, service 5.0 with hmi devices can possibly bring back tourism from being disintegrated. such service applications are the new social innovations leading to sustainable service and a sophisticated experience for all tourists.\",\"challenges and opportunities of digital information at the intersection of big data analytics and supply chain management. purpose: despite the variety of supply chain management (scm) research, little attention has been given to the use of big data analytics for increased information exploitation in a supply chain. the purpose of this paper is to contribute to theory development in scm by investigating the potential impacts of big data analytics on information usage in a corporate and supply chain context. as it is imperative for companies in the supply chain to have access to up-to-date, accurate, and meaningful information, the exploratory research will provide insights into the opportunities and challenges emerging from the adoption of big data analytics in scm. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: although big data analytics is gaining increasing attention in management, empirical research on the topic is still scarce. due to the limited availability of comparable material at the intersection of big data analytics and scm, the authors apply the delphi research technique. findings: portraying the emerging transition trend from a digital business environment, the presented delphi study findings contribute to extant knowledge by identifying 43 opportunities and challenges linked to the emergence of big data analytics from a corporate and supply chain perspective. research limitations\\u002fimplications: these constructs equip the research community with a first collection of aspects, which could provide the basis to tailor further research at the nexus of big data analytics and scm. originality\\u002fvalue: the research adds to the existing knowledge base as no empirical research has been presented so far specifically assessing opportunities and challenges on corporate and supply chain level with a special focus on the implications imposed through big data analytics.\",\"mobile payment: understanding the determinants of customer adoption and intention to recommend the technology. mobile payment is receiving growing attention globally, from consumers to merchants, as an alternative to using cash, check, or credit cards. the potential of this technology is enormous. this study aims to identify the main determinants of mobile payment adoption and the intention to recommend this technology. we advance the body of knowledge on this subject by proposing an innovative research model that combines the strengths of two well-known theories; the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut2) with the innovation characteristics of the diffusion of innovations (doi), with perceived security and intention to recommend the technology constructs. the research model was empirically tested using 301 responses from an online survey conducted in a european country, portugal. data was analyzed using the structured equation modeling (sem). we found compatibility, perceived technology security, performance expectations, innovativeness, and social influence to have significant direct and indirect effects over the adoption of mobile payment and the intention to recommend this technology. the relevance of customer's intention to recommend mobile payment technology in social networks and other means of communication was also confirmed, supporting the recommendation to include it in social marketing campaigns and in future technology adoption studies. for researchers this study provides a basis for further refinement of individual models of acceptance. for practitioners, understanding the key constructs is crucial to design, refine, and implement mobile payment services, applications, and products that achieve high consumer acceptance, value, and high rates of positive recommendations in social networks.\",\"modifying utaut and innovation diffusion theory to reveal online shopping behavior: familiarity and perceived risk as mediators. this study adapted the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) and innovation diffusion to show how virtual community building, website performance expectancy, effort expectancy, trialability, and two mediators (familiarity and perceived risk) interact and affect online shopping intention. a total of 430 valid participants were collected, all of whom had the goal of buying a smart phone. the results of the structural equation model analysis show that performance expectancy and effort expectancy positively affect website familiarity; virtual community building and trialability positively influence product familiarity; and perceived risk negatively affects purchase intention. in addition to the effects demonstrated by the regression results, website familiarity and product familiarity also have mediation effects. finally, this study suggests that managers should provide a complete community to consumers in order to enable them to share information; furthermore, they should also provide details of product trials on the website, so that consumers can increase their familiarity with both the website and the products, as this can then raise consumer purchase intention.\",\"continuous usage of e-participation: the role of the sense of virtual community. local governments around the world are increasingly implementing e-participation platforms to involve citizens in consultation and decision-making processes. e-participation platforms usually succeed and produce positive effects in the community when adopted in the long-term scenario. the adoption of those platforms is still a challenge for local governments. the understanding of the factors that influence the continuous intention to use e-participation over time is critical for the design of diffusion and promotion strategies that motivate the citizens to keep using e-participation. this article explores the drivers that predict the post-adoption of e-participation platforms from the perspective of the sense of virtual community theory, that is the degree of affective attachment to a given community mediated by information technology. specifically, our research model evaluates the association between the sense of virtual community with use behaviour and the continuous intention to use e-participation. structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the data collected from 370 citizens who experienced an e-participation platform hosted by a european capital city. we found out that the direct association between the sense of virtual community and use was significant. even though the direct association between the sense of virtual community and the continuous intention was non-significant, the indirect association sense of virtual community to use to continuous intention was statistically significant. this finding may indicate that the use behaviour is triggered by the influence of other members of the community for a short period of time, but it does not persist to influence the continuous intention over time.\",\"special section introduction: ubiquitous it and digital vulnerabilities. while information technology benefits society in numerous ways, it unfortunately also has potential to create new vulnerabilities. this special issue intends to stimulate thought and research into understanding and mitigating these vulnerabilities. we identify four mechanisms by which ubiquitous computing makes various entities (people, devices, organizations, societies, etc.) more vulnerable, including: increased visibility, enhanced cloaking, increased interconnectedness, and decreased costs. we use the papers in the special issue to explain these mechanisms, and then outline a research agenda for future work on digital vulnerabilities spanning four areas that are, or could become, significant societal problems with implications at multiple levels of analysis: online harassment and incivility, technology-driven economic inequality, industrial internet of things, and algorithmic ethics and bias.\",\"antecedent variables of intentions to use an autonomous shuttle: moving beyond tam and tpb? [les variables pr\\u00e9dictives des intentions d'utilisation d'une navette autonome : aller au-del\\u00e0 du mat et de la tcp ?]. introduction the use of autonomous shuttles (as) seems a promising mobility solution. technology acceptance model (tam) and theory of planned behavior (tpb) provide useful a priori frameworks to study as\\u2019 acceptance, but they might arguably benefit from a specific, as-related adjustment. objective to provide a preliminary model of as\\u2019 acceptance based on both laboratory and field data. method undergraduate students (n = 370, study 1) and both the potential and the real as users (n = 162, study 2) answered surveys concerned with the key tam, tpb and evidence-based additional variables. results some of tam and tpb constructs accounted for 40% of intentions to use an as while further 13 to 16% were explained systematically by such variables as group norms, affective attitudes and first as experience. conclusion some of tam and tpb constructs capture substantial proportion of as\\u2019 acceptance while additional social, motivational and experience-related factors should be taken into account.\",\"investigating the link among ict, electricity consumption, air pollution, and economic growth in eu countries. this study investigates the relationship between information and communication technology (ict) penetration, electricity consumption, economic growth, and environmental pollution within a multivariate framework. a panel of 16 eu countries was analyzed over the 1990\\u20132017 period. the results of the dumitrescu-hurlin panel causality tests reveal the existence of a one-way causality running from ict usage and electricity consumption and which, in turn, causes a rise in co2 emissions and improves gdp. panel mean-group regression results highlight that economic growth is also an important driver of electricity demand as a 1% economic growth rate is associated with a 0.13% increase in per capita electricity consumption. these results demonstrate for the first time in the literature a single assessment on the linkages among ict, electricity use and environmental pollution with a novel focus on the eu. based on these results, adequate measures should encompass the adverse environmental effects of ict, while energy saving policies must be carefully implemented in order not to hinder economic growth.\",\"consumers acceptance of artificially intelligent (ai) device use in service delivery. this study develops and empirically tests a theoretical model of artificially intelligent (ai) device use acceptance (aidua) that aims to explain customers\\u2019 willingness to accept ai device use in service encounters. the proposed model incorporates three acceptance generation stages (primary appraisal, secondary appraisal, and outcome stage) and six antecedents (social influence, hedonic motivation, anthropomorphism, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and emotion). utilizing data collected from potential customers, the proposed aidua model is tested. findings suggest that customers go through a three-step acceptance generation process in determining whether to accept the use of ai devices during their service interactions. findings indicate that social influence and hedonic motivation are positively related to performance expectancy while anthropomorphism is positively related to effort expectancy. both performance and effort expectancy are significant antecedents of customer emotions, which determines customers\\u2019 acceptance of ai device use in service encounters. this study provides a conceptual ai device acceptance framework that can be used by other researchers to better investigate ai related topics in the service context.\",\"iot in supply chain management: opportunities and challenges for businesses in early industry 4.0 context. the internet of things (iot) is a global network of smart devices that integrate physical and digital worlds. while the iot is reported to be a foundation technology for the emerged industry 4.0 era, empirical evidence related to iot use in supply chain management is scant. this study, therefore, investigates the opportunities and challenges of iot use in the supply chains using grounded theory based interviews with managers from the australian retail industry. the thematic analysis using nvivo reveals that iot deployment improves visibility of goods movement, data capture, partner communication, and business intelligence. however, retailers face challenges due to the lack of top management initiative, new technology acquisition cost, stakeholders' reluctance to accept change, unwillingness to share data, and inadequate interoperability between partner systems. the study offers a proof-of-concept of iot benefits that strengthen the iot-related investment decision, sheds light on adoption challenges and develops propositions for future research.\",\"big data in operations and supply chain management: current trends and future perspectives. operations and supply chain management encompasses a vast domain and hence provides a myriad of opportunities for huge voluminous data generated from various sources in real time. such huge data having the requisite properties of big data can be utilised to gain critical and fundamental insights towards optimising the operations and supply chain and thus making effective and efficient decisions. in the recent years, research interest in big data has increased substantially and therefore researchers and practitioners have also tried to tap the capabilities of big data to optimise operations and supply chain management. in this paper, the literature relating to the integration of big data with operations and supply chain management is reviewed. in particular, reviewing past work is primarily focused on three key areas of the operations and supply chain management, namely manufacturing, procurement and logistics where big data has been applied. in addition to reviewing past literature, paper also proposes application of big data in operations and supply chain management.\",\"gathering expert opinions for social robots\\u2019 ethical, legal, and societal concerns: findings from four international workshops. social robots, those that exhibit personality and communicate with us using high-level dialogue and natural cues, will soon be part of our daily lives. in this paper, we gather expert opinions from different international workshops exploring ethical, legal, and social (els) concerns associated with social robots. in contrast to literature that looks at specific challenges, often from a certain disciplinary angle, our contribution to the literature provides an overview of the els discussions in a holistic fashion, shaped by active deliberation with a multitude of experts across four workshops held between 2015 and 2017 held in major international workshops (erf, newfriends, jsai-isai). it also explores pathways to address the identified challenges. our contribution is in line with the latest european robot regulatory initiatives but covers an area of research that the latest ai and robot governance strategies have scarcely covered. specifically, we highlight challenges to the use of social robots from a user perspective, including issues such as privacy, autonomy, and the dehumanization of interactions; or from a worker perspective, including issues such as the possible replacement of jobs through robots. the paper also compiles the recommendations to these els issues the experts deem appropriate to mitigate compounding risks. by then contrasting these challenges and solutions with recent ai and robot regulatory strategies, we hope to inform the policy debate and set the scene for further research.\",\"advancing knowledge through literature reviews: \\u2018what\\u2019, \\u2018why\\u2019, and \\u2018how to

literature review is part and parcel of scholarly research. though many literature review guides are available, they remain limited because they do not adequately account for the different types of literature review. noteworthily, literature reviews can manifest as part of conceptual or empirical studies, or as independent studies, in which the latter may be curated in various ways. moreover, despite its importance and popularity, literature reviews, particularly as independent studies, continue to attract unfair criticism and remain scarce in service research. to address the aforementioned gaps, this article endeavors to provide an overview and guidelines for writing literature reviews. specifically, this article explains (1) what a literature review is and is not, (2) why literature reviews are valuable, and (3) how to conduct a literature review, as well as (4) the areas of service research and (5) the innovative ways in which literature reviews can be curated in the future.\",\"measuring gdp in the digital economy: increasing dependence on uncaptured gdp. as revealed by tapscott in his best-seller the digital economy published in 1994, the internet has dramatically changed the way of conducting business and our daily lives. further advancement of digital innovation, including cloud, mobile services, and artificial intelligence, has augmented this change significantly and provided us with extraordinary services and welfare never anticipated before. however, contrary to such an accomplishment, productivity in industrialized countries now confronts an apparent decline raising the question of a possible productivity paradox in the digital economy. the limitations of gross domestic product (gdp) statistics in measuring the advancement of the digital economy have become an important subject. while this mismatch is an old problem rooted in the dynamics of product innovations, since mismatch brought about by information and communication technology (ict) is very strong, finding a solution to this critical issue has become highly crucial in the digital economy. based on an intensive review of preceding studies and empirical analyses of national, industrial and individual behaviors in the digital economy, this paper attempted to draw a perspective on this critical issue. by means of an analysis of co-evolution among a shift in people's preferences from economic functionality to supra-functionality beyond economic value, the advancement of ict and paradigm change to uncaptured gdp, a solution to this critical issue was investigated. new insights for measuring the digital economy were explored which provide insight into integration of national accounts with product-oriented micro-analysis efforts.\",\"artificial intelligence and business models in the sustainable development goals perspective: a systematic literature review. this paper investigates the literary corpus on the role of artificial intelligence (ai) in the construction of sustainable business models (sbms). it provides a quantitative overview of the academic literature that constitutes the field. the paper discusses the relationships between ai and rapid developments in machine learning and sustainable development (sd). specifically, the aim is to understand whether this branch of computer science can influence production and consumption patterns to achieve sustainable resource management according to sustainable development goals (sdgs) outlined in the un 2030 agenda. moreover, the paper aims to highlight the role of knowledge management systems (kms) in the cultural drift toward the spread of ai for sbms. despite the importance of the topic, there is no comprehensive review of the ai and sbm literature in light of sdgs. based on a database containing 73 publications in english with publication dates from 1990 to 2019, a bibliometric analysis is conducted. the findings show that the innovation challenge involves ethical, social, economic, and legal aspects. thus, considering that the development potential of ai is linked to the un 2030 agenda for sd, especially to sdg#12, our results also outline the framework of the existing literature on ai and sdgs, especially sdg#12, including ai's association with the cultural drift (cd) in the sbms. the paper highlights the key contributions, which are: i) a comprehensive review of the key underlying relationship between ai and sbms, offering a holistic view as needed, ii) identifying a research gap regarding kms through ai, and iii) the implications of ai concerning sdg#12. academic and managerial implications are also discussed regarding kms in the sbms, where the ai can represent the vehicle to meet the sdgs allowing for the identification of the cultural change required by enterprises to achieve sustainable goals. thus, business companies, academic research practitioners, and state policy should focus on the further development of the use of ai in sbms.\",\"digital transformation, labour share, and industrial heterogeneity. for this study, we examined the relationship between the digital economy and labour share from the perspective of industrial heterogeneity. to analyse the digital economy's impact on labour share, we introduced a digital economy into a framework concerning labour share. we then built a mathematical model describing the influencing mechanism of the digital economy on labour share. we generated data from chinese listed enterprises (n=3778) from 2007 to 2019 and applied a two-way fixed effects model to scrutinise the data. the results show that (1) the digital economy affects labour share through three countervailing forces: the productivity improvement effect, factor-biased effect, and scale return change effect; (2) the labour share would change to -0.12%, 0.36%, and -0.48% through the productivity improvement effect, factor-biased effect, and scale return change effect, respectively, with a 0.1% increase in the digital economy, indicating that the labour-biased effect is the main component of the increase in labour share, and the scale return effect is the primary source of the decline in labour share; (3) a phenomenon similar to the digital divide exists in the factor-biased and scale return change effects for heterogeneous industries. theoretically and empirically, this study contributes to the existing findings and offers useful managerial insights.\",\"governing digital trade. as global data flows and digital technologies transform international trade, governments and regulators have to determine how to benefit from these developments while maintaining the integrity of their domestic regulations. currently, governments are increasingly restricting global data flows and requiring data localization, undermining the economic benefits of digital trade. to address this trend will require a system of digital trade governance that has two key elements. one element is new digital trade rules, some of which exist in the wto and others which are being developed in free trade agreements. the other is international regulatory cooperation to develop standards and mutual recognition agreements in areas such as privacy and consumer protection that gives domestic regulators confidence that allowing data to leave their jurisdiction will not undermine achievement of domestic regulatory goals. in the absence of such regulatory cooperation, governments are likely to continue to restrict data flows, relying on the exceptions provisions to their digital trade commitments.\",\"frontiers: machines vs. humans: the impact of artificial intelligence chatbot disclosure on customer purchases. empowered by artificial intelligence (ai), chatbots are surging as new technologies with both business potential and customer pushback. this study exploits field experiment data on more than 6,200 customers who are randomized to receive highly structured outbound sales calls from chatbots or human workers. results suggest that undisclosed chatbots are as effective as proficient workers and four times more effective than inexperienced workers in engendering customer purchases. however, a disclosure of chatbot identity before the machine\\u2013customer conversation reduces purchase rates by more than 79.7%. additional analyses find that these results are robust to nonresponse bias and hang-ups, and the chatbot disclosure substantially decreases call length. exploration of the mechanisms reveals that when customers know the conversational partner is not a human, they are curt and purchase less because they perceive the disclosed bot as less knowledgeable and less empathetic. the negative disclosure effect seems to be driven by a subjective human perception against machines, despite the objective competence of ai chatbots. fortunately, such negative impact can be mitigated by a late disclosure timing strategy and customer prior ai experience. these findings offer useful implications for chatbot applications, customer targeting, and advertising in conversational commerce.\",\"heterogeneity and transferring practices: implementing flow manufacturing in multiple plants. adopting new practices to develop capabilities and enhance competitiveness is a goal for many firms. this study of a corporate initiative to implement flow manufacturing in multiple plants highlights some elements of the interaction between the content of a complex practice, the sources of the practice knowledge, and the characteristics and competitive priorities of the recipients of the practice. heterogeneity among the plants, stemming from both differences in resource endowments and differences in choices made by managers, presents challenges to achieving firm-wide distinctiveness.\",\"factors affecting value co-creation through artificial intelligence in tourism: a general literature review. purpose: this is a general review study aiming to specify the key customer-based factors and technologies that influence the value co-creation (vcc) process through artificial intelligence (ai) and automation in the hospitality and tourism industry. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the study uses a theory-based general literature review approach to explore key customer-based factors and technologies influencing vcc in the tourism industry. by reviewing the relevant literature, the authors conclude a theoretical framework postulating the determinants of vcc in the ai-driven tourism industry. findings: this paper identifies customers' perceptions, attitudes, trust, social influence, hedonic motivations, anthropomorphism and prior experience as customer-based factors to vcc through the use of ai. service robots, ai-enabled self-service kiosks, chatbots, metaversal tourism and new reality, machine learning (ml) and natural language processing (nlp) are technologies that influence vcc. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the results of this research inform a theoretical framework articulating the human and ai elements for future research set to expand the models predicting vcc in the tourism industry. originality\\u002fvalue: few studies have examined consumer-related factors that influence their participation in the vcc process through automation and ai.\",\"ai voice bots: a services marketing research agenda. purpose: this paper aims to document how ai has changed the way consumers make decisions and propose how that change impacts services marketing, service research and service management. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a review of the literature, documentation of sales and customer service experiences support the evolution of bot-driven consumer decision-making, proposing the bot-driven service platform as a key component of the service experience. findings: today the focus is on convenience, the less time and effort, the better. the authors propose that ai has taken convenience to a new level for consumers. by using bots as their service of choice, consumers outsource their decisions to algorithms, hence give little attention to traditional consumer decision-making models and brand emphasis. at the moment, this is especially true for low involvement types of decisions, but high involvement decisions are on the cusp of delegating to ai. therefore, management needs to change how they view consumers\\u2019 decision-making-processes and how services are being managed. research limitations\\u002fimplications: in an ai-convenience driven service economy, the emphasis needs to be on search ranking or warehouse stock, rather than the traditional drivers of brand values such as service quality. customer experience management will shift from interaction with products and services toward interactions with new service platforms such as ai, bots. hence, service marketing, as the authors know it might be in decline and be replaced by an efficient complex attribute computer decision-making model. originality\\u002fvalue: the change in consumer behavior leads to a change in the service marketing approach needed in the world of ai. the bot, the new service platform is now in charge of search and choice for many purchase situations.\",\"engaged to a robot? the role of ai in service. this article develops a strategic framework for using artificial intelligence (ai) to engage customers for different service benefits. this framework lays out guidelines of how to use different ais to engage customers based on considerations of nature of service task, service offering, service strategy, and service process. ai develops from mechanical, to thinking, and to feeling. as ai advances to a higher intelligence level, more human service employees and human intelligence (hi) at the intelligence levels lower than that level should be used less. thus, at the current level of ai development, mechanical service should be performed mostly by mechanical ai, thinking service by both thinking ai and hi, and feeling service mostly by hi. mechanical ai should be used for standardization when service is routine and transactional, for cost leadership, and mostly at the service delivery stage. thinking ai should be used for personalization when service is data-rich and utilitarian, for quality leadership, and mostly at the service creation stage. feeling ai should be used for relationalization when service is relational and high touch, for relationship leadership, and mostly at the service interaction stage. we illustrate various ai applications for the three major ai benefits, providing managerial guidelines for service providers to leverage the advantages of ai as well as future research implications for service researchers to investigate ai in service from modeling, consumer, and policy perspectives.\",\"the effect of artificial intelligence on carbon intensity: evidence from china's industrial sector. artificial intelligence (ai) is becoming the engine of a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation; as such, it has attracted much attention of scholars in recent years. surprisingly, scarce studies have shed lights on the effects of ai on the environment, especially with respect to carbon intensity. based on the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (stirpat) model, we use chinese industrial sector data from 2005 to 2016 to investigate how ai affects carbon intensity. the empirical results show that ai, as measured separately by the adoption of robotics by industry and the number of academic ai-related papers, significantly reduces carbon intensity. the results remain robust after addressing endogenous issues. we find that there are both stages and industrial heterogeneity in the effects of ai on carbon intensity. ai had a more decrease effect on carbon intensity during the 12th five-year plan than the 11th. compared with capital-intensive industries, ai tends to have a more decrease effect on carbon intensity in the labor-intensive and tech-intensive industries. to enlarge the effects of ai on reducing carbon intensity, the government should promote the development and application of ai and implement differentiated policies in line with the industry characteristics.\",\"factors driving the adoption of smart home technology: an empirical assessment. smart home technology, an application of internet of things (iot), provides households with e.g., comfort, control and convenience. the technology has been around for sometimes, but its prevalence is not yet widespread, and thus the potentials have largely been underestimated. the purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive model that can explain a large percentage of variance in the intention to use smart home technology. to do so, this paper, based on technology acceptance model, diffusion of innovation theory and consumer perceived innovativeness, proposes an integrated model and validates it through structural equation modelling on data collected from 156 respondents. the results reveal that compatibility, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are important determinants affecting the adoption of smart home technology. moreover, trialability while show no direct effect on the intention to use, its affect is realized indirectly via constructs of pu and peou. the sem results also show that the perceived cost negatively impacts the intention to use. this paper is one of the first empirical attempt that includes consumer perceived innovativeness in the model. this paper contributes to the literature of iot, in particular to smart home technology research. some theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\",\"robots and firms. we study the microeconomic implications of robot adoption using a rich panel data set of spanish manufacturing firms over a 27-year period (1990-2016). we provide causal evidence on two central questions: (1) which firm characteristics prompt firms to adopt robots? (2) what is the impact of robots on adopting firms relative to non-adopting firms? to address these questions, we look at our data through the lens of recent attempts in the literature to formalise the implications of robot technology. as for the first question, we establish robust evidence for positive selection, i.e., ex ante better performing firms (measured through output and labour productivity) are more likely to adopt robots. on the other hand, conditional on size, ex ante more skill-intensive firms are less likely to do so. as for the second question, we find that robot adoption generates substantial output gains in the vicinity of 20-25% within four years, reduces the labour cost share by 5-7% points, and leads to net job creation at a rate of 10%. these results are robust to controlling for non-random selection into robot adoption through a difference-in-differences approach combined with a propensity score reweighting estimator. to further validate these results, we also offer structural estimates of total factor productivity (tfp) where robot technology enters the (endogenous) productivity process of firms. the results demonstrate a positive causal effect of robots on productivity as well as a complementarity between robots and exporting in boosting productivity.\",\"a step toward reducing air pollution in top asian economies: the role of green energy, eco-innovation, and environmental taxes. environmental degradation is significantly studied both in the past and the current literature; however, steps towards reducing the environmental pollution in carbon emission and haze pollution like pm2.5 are not under rational attention. this study tries to cover this gap while considering the carbon emission and pm2.5 through observing the role of renewable energy, non-renewable energy, environmental taxes, and ecological innovation for the top asian economies from 1990 to 2017. for analysis purposes, this research considers cross-sectional dependence analysis, unit root test with and without structural break (pesaran, 2007), slope heterogeneity analysis, westerlund and edgerton (2008) panel cointegration analysis, banerjee and carrion-i-silvestre (2017) cointegration analysis, long-short run cs-ardl results, as well as amg and ccemg for robustness check. the empirical evidence in both the short- and long-run has confirmed the negative and significant effect of renewable energy sources, ecological innovation, and environmental taxes on carbon emissions and pm2.5. whereas, non-renewable energy sources are causing environmental degradation in the targeted economies. finally, various policy implications related to carbon emission and haze pollution like pm2.5 are also provided to control their harmful effect on the natural environment.\",\"a data-driven text mining and semantic network analysis for design information retrieval. with the advent of the big-data era, massive information stored in electronic and digital forms on the internet become valuable resources for knowledge discovery in engineering design. traditional document retrieval method based on document indexing focuses on retrieving individual documents related to the query, but is incapable of discovering the various associations between individual knowledge concepts. ontology-based technologies, which can extract the inherent relationships between concepts by using advanced text mining tools, can be applied to improve design information retrieval in the largescale unstructured textual data environment. however, few of the public available ontology database stands on a design and engineering perspective to establish the relations between knowledge concepts. this paper develops a wordnet focusing on design and engineering associations by integrating the text mining approaches to construct an unsupervised learning ontology network. subsequent probability and velocity network analysis are applied with different statistical behaviors to evaluate the correlation degree between concepts for design information retrieval. the validation results show that the probability and velocity analysis on our constructed ontology network can help recognize the high related complex design and engineering associations between elements. finally, an engineering design case study demonstrates the use of our constructed semantic network in real-world project for design relations retrieval.\",\"detecting customers knowledge from social media big data: toward an integrated methodological framework based on netnography and business analytics. purpose: this paper aims to demonstrate how the integration of netnography and business analytics can support companies in the process of value creation from social big data by leveraging on customer relationship management and customer knowledge management (ckm). design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this paper adopts the methodology of a single case study by using desk analysis, netnography and business analytics. the context of analysis has been identified into the case of aurora company, a well-known producer of fountain pens. findings: the case demonstrates how the integration of big data analytics and netnography is relevant for the development of a customer relationship management strategy. the results obtained have been categorized according to the three main categories of customer knowledge, such as knowledge for, from and about customer. research limitations\\u002fimplications: this paper presents implications for the advancement of the theory on ckm by demonstrating, as the acquisition, storage and management of data generated by customers on social media require the adoption of a cross-disciplinary approach resulting from the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches. the framework is structured as methodological tool to detect knowledge in virtual community. practical implications: practical implications arise for managers and entrepreneurs in terms of value creation from knowledge assets generated on social big data through the management of the customers\\u2019 relationship and data-driven innovation patterns. originality\\u002fvalue: this paper offers an original contribution of integration of well-established research streams. the focus on the knowledge under the perspectives of information assets for, from and about customers in the debate on value creation and management of big data is an element of value offered by this study in addition to the comprehension of strategies of social customer relationship management as actual initiative embraced by a company in the leveraging of innovation and tradition.\",\"salesperson communication effectiveness in a digital sales interaction 1. b2b buyers are exhibiting an increased preference to transact digitally with vendors. a topic which has yet to receive sufficient academic attention in this modern selling environment is salesperson communication effectiveness. accordingly, this article: 1) defines digital sales interactions (dsis) as technology-enabled, face-to-face buyer-seller exchanges; 2) proposes a typology of dsis to set the stage to examine salesperson communication effectiveness; 3) introduces a framework that reifies the sender's auditory and visual cues that can influence receivers' thoughts (i.e., cognition, affect, intention) and activity (i.e., purchase behavior, advocacy); 4) suggests theoretical lenses that can illuminate various aspects of the salesperson's communication barrage; 5) advances how machine learning can be applied to understand what constitutes effective communication in a digital interaction by asking: to what extent does what a salesperson says (auditory cues) and how s\\u002fhe says it (visual cues) impact her\\u002fhis effectiveness in a dsi?; and 6) concludes by noting promising future research directions for b2b marketing researchers.\",\"towards an integrated generative design framework. design creativity techniques encourage divergent thinking. but how well do the existing generative design techniques support this requirement? how can these general techniques be augmented for supporting design exploration and creativity? this paper investigates these questions through a review of five different generative design techniques used in architectural design that includes cellular automata, genetic algorithms, l-systems, shape grammars, and swarm intelligence. based on the literature on design cognition and the recent theoretical works on digital design thinking, this paper proposes the need for an integrated generative design framework to enhance design exploration support for human designers. potential challenges and strategies towards developing such an integrated framework are discussed.\",\"the impact of sustainable development strategy on sustainable supply chain firm performance in the digital transformation era. availability of limited resources presents the need for sustainable development strategies to achieve sustainable performance. however, in the era of digitalization and globalization many researchers explored the role of digital technologies in improving sustainable performance. however, the literature on the role of collaboration and coordination in a digitally enabled supply chain (sc) to achieve sustainability is still lacking. this study aims to investigate the effect of supply chain collaboration and coordination (scc), sustainable development strategy (sds), digital transformation (dit), and collaborative advantages (coa) on sustainable supply chain firm performance (sscfp). the conceptual model is based on the relational view (rv), transaction cost economics (tce), technology, organization and environment (toe), and resource-based view (rbv) theories. this study utilizes structural equation modeling (sem) to analyze data collected from 361 respondents of the automotive industry in india. the findings show that scc positively affects sds and dit. sds positively affects dit, coa, and dit positively affects sscfp. dit fully mediates the relationship between scc and coa. the study suggests that managers can apply scc, sds, and dit in series to achieve sustainable performance. however, the coa can only be enhanced in the digitalized sc. the study provides empirical evidence to policymakers and practitioners for the synergy between scc, sds, dit, and coa to achieve sustainable performance in the sc's manufacturing firm.\",\"artificial intelligence-driven innovation for enhancing supply chain resilience and performance under the effect of supply chain dynamism: an empirical investigation. supply chain resilience (scres) and performance have become increasingly important in the wake of the recent supply chain disruptions caused by subsequent pandemics and crisis. besides, the context of digitalization, integration, and globalization of the supply chain has raised an increasing awareness of advanced information processing techniques such as artificial intelligence (ai) in building scres and improving supply chain performance (scp). the present study investigates the direct and indirect effects of ai, scres, and scp under a context of dynamism and uncertainty of the supply chain. in doing so, we have conceptualized the use of ai in the supply chain on the organizational information processing theory (oipt). the developed framework was evaluated using a structural equation modeling (sem) approach. survey data was collected from 279 firms representing different sizes, operating in various sectors, and countries. our findings suggest that while ai has a direct impact on scp in the short-term, it is recommended to exploit its information processing capabilities to build scres for long-lasting scp. this study is among the first to provide empirical evidence on maximizing the benefits of ai capabilities to generate sustained scp. the study could be further extended using a longitudinal investigation to explore more facets of the phenomenon.\",\"understanding mobile banking: the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology combined with cultural moderators. the fast advancement of communications, mobile technologies, and the proliferation of smart devices has increased the importance of mobile banking services for banks, financial institutions, and users. in developing countries, especially in africa, mobile banking can play a strong role, providing a way to overcome financial exclusion and physical distance by allowing local population to conduct financial transactions. acceptance studies in this region are scarce, leaving us an almost unexplored area of research. we advance the body of knowledge on mobile banking acceptance by proposing an innovative and comprehensive theoretical model that combines the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut2) of venkatesh, thong, and xu (2012), with cultural moderators from hofstede, providing new insights into factors affecting the acceptation and how culture influences individual use behaviour. the model was tested using structural equation modelling (sem), in a quantitative study conducted in an african country, reinforcing data and knowledge available from this important region. performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habit were found to be the most significant antecedents of behaviour intention. to explain the mobile banking use behaviour the habit and culture moderator effects on behaviour intention over use behaviour were the most important drivers. collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, short term and power distance were found to be the most significant cultural moderators.\",\"a review of the trend of microlearning. purpose: microlearning has been considered as a promising topic in work-based learning. this paper aims to review the trends of microlearning in terms of related publications and internet searches. hopefully, the findings can serve as a reference for the education sector, government, business and academia to promote, design and use microlearning. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: in this study, two sets of analysis were conducted. firstly, the authors analysed the publication trend of microlearning. second, the authors analysed the trend of internet searches related to microlearning. more specifically, the authors analysed real-world data of 14 years obtained from scopus and google trends for the purpose. these data include the first relevant publication found in the database. findings: in total, 476 relevant publications have been identified during 2006\\u20132019. according to the findings from the analysis of the identified publications, microlearning is a relevantly new and emerging global topic involving authors, affiliations and funding sponsors from different countries. moreover, many microlearning-related publications were conducted from perspectives of e-learning or mobile learning. furthermore, the authors notice higher education was the most frequently mentioned education level in the identified publications. on the other hand, language learning (i.e. second language, vocabulary learning, etc.) had been mentioned more times in the titles and abstracts than other subject areas. overall, the increasing trend of publications on \\u201cmicrolearning\\u201d (as a knowledge supply) is in line with the established increasing internet searches of \\u201cmicrolearning\\u201d (as a practical demand) in recent years. practical implications: from the work-based learning perspective, microlearning has been considered as one of the key topics in talent development topics. policymakers, educators, researchers and participators have the responsibility to explore how to promote, design and use microlearning to help people to learn in the right direction through valid knowledge with ethical consideration. originality\\u002fvalue: although many works had been done on microlearning, there is a lack of comprehensive studies reviewing the trends of microlearning in terms of related publications and internet searches. this study aims to fill this gap by analysing real-world data obtained from scopus and google trends \\u2013 these data include the first relevant publication found in the database. the authors believe this is the first time that a study has been conducted to comprehensively review the development trends of microlearning. hopefully, this study can shed some light on related research.\",\"digital humans in fashion: will consumers interact?. the ongoing covid-19 pandemic is disrupting the fashion industry and forcing fashion businesses to accelerate their digital transformation. the increased need for more sustainable fashion business operations, when coupled with the prospect that business might never be as usual again, calls for innovative e-commerce led practices. recently, stakeholders have been experimenting with the idea of introducing digital humans for a more active role in fashion through the developments in artificial intelligence, virtual, augmented and mixed reality. as there is a lack of all-important empirical evidence on the consumer's propensity to interact with digital humans, we aim to quantitatively analyse consumer attitudes towards the propensity to interact with digital humans to uncover insights to help fashion businesses seeking to diversify their operations. the results reveal interesting, and statistically significant insights which can be useful for fashion business stakeholders for designing, developing, testing, and marketing digital human-based solutions. besides, our findings contribute current insights to the existing literature on how consumers interact with digital humans, where research tends to be scarce.\",\"artificial intelligence and blockchain integration in business: trends from a bibliometric-content analysis. artificial intelligence (ai) and blockchain are the two disruptive technologies emerging from the fourth industrial revolution (ir4.0) that have introduced radical shifts in the industry. the amalgamation of ai and blockchain holds tremendous potential to create new business models enabled through digitalization. although research on the application and convergence of ai and blockchain exists, our understanding of the utility of its integration for business remains fragmented. to address this gap, this study aims to characterize the applications and benefits of integrated ai and blockchain platforms across different verticals of business. using bibliometric analysis, this study reveals the most influential articles on the subject based on their publications, citations, and importance in the intellectual network. using content analysis, this study sheds light on the subject\\u2019s intellectual structure, which is underpinned by four major thematic clusters focusing on supply chains, healthcare, secure transactions, and finance and accounting. the study concludes with 10 application areas in business that can benefit from these technologies.\",\"does industrial robot application promote green technology innovation in the manufacturing industry?. manufacturing green technology innovation is important in achieving climate goals and is the key in promoting sustainable economic development. using the industrial robot data and manufacturing green technology innovation data from 34 countries from 1993 to 2019, this paper reveals the mechanism and heterogeneity of the application of industrial robots (ira) affecting green technology innovation (gti) in the global manufacturing sector. the results indicate the following: (1) the ira significantly promotes gti, and the endogenous and robustness tests show that the results are robust. (2) the ira promotes gti with a dual-channel mechanism\\u2014the mediating effect of green r&d investment and the moderating effect of environmental regulation. (3) there is two-dimensional heterogeneity in terms of the application industries and regions in terms of the green technology innovation effects of industrial robot applications. (4) in addition, the implementation of industry 4.0 is in favor of the stimulating effects of industrial robots on green technology innovation. finally, valuable policy advices are proposed based on the empirical results.\",\"the alternative energy utilization and common regional trade outlook in eu-27: evidence from common correlated effects. the role of low-carbon energy and trade on the environment has drawn several studies that have looked at issues from different perspectives, thus yielding differing conclusions. considering the current emphasis on the cop25 conference and the commitment to cut down carbon emissions level, this study also draws strength from the united nations sustainable development goals (unsdgs) that comprises of positive strides for access to clean and responsible energy consumption (sdgs 7, 12) and climate change mitigation issues (sdg-13). to this end, this study is a timely outlook that underpins the case of the european union (eu) countries as well as the root cause of anthropogenic activities on clean trajectory of global environment. hence, we investigate the connection between alternative and sustainable energy source, trade, income and emissions in 27 selected european union economies by utilizing data covering the period 1990\\u20132017 on an annual frequency. we used second-generation panel model estimators to analyze the relationship between the variables in the long-run. specifically, the long run results from the mg (mean group), amg (augmented mean group), and ccemg (common correlated effects mean group) estimators reveal that sustainable and alternative energy sources have a negative significant impact on pollutant emissions while trade and income have a positive impact on carbon emissions except that the impact of trade is insignificant. although the positive impact of openness in trade on carbon emission is insignificant, the positive impact suggests that the free-trade policy that is currently in place in the eu should further incorporate sustainable development goals (sdgs) to avoid the outsourcing of carbon emissions among the member countries. causality tests reveal a feedback hypothesis between renewable energy, income, trade, and carbon emanations. the investigation proposes expanded utilization of sustainable power source to mitigate carbon emissions in the european union.\",\"temporarily divide to conquer: centralized, decentralized, and reintegrated organizational approaches to exploration and adaptation. to create a competitive advantage, firms need to find activity configurations that are not only internally consistent, but also appropriate given the firm's current environment. this challenge is particularly acute after firms have experienced an environmental change that has shifted the existing competitive landscape and created new, high-performing sets of activity choices. how should firms organize to explore and search such an altered performance landscape? while it has been noted that adaptive entities need to maintain a balance of exploration and exploitation, little is known about how different organizational structures moderate this balance. with the help of an agent-based simulation model, we study the value of three different organizational structures: a centralized organization, in which decisions are made only at the level of the firm as a whole; a decentralized organization, in which decisions are made independently in two divisions; and a temporarily decentralized firm, which starts out with a decentralized structure and later reintegrates. we find that if interactions among a firm's activities are pervasive, neither the centralized nor the permanently decentralized organizational structure leads to high performance. in this case, temporary decentralization - an organizational structure that has not found much attention in the literature - yields the highest long-term performance. this organizational structure allows the firm both to avoid low-performing activity configurations and to eventually coordinate across its divisions. thus, even if the decision problem a firm faces is not fully decomposable, a temporary bifurcation can lead to a higher long-term performance outcome. initial decentralized exploration is, however, costly in the short run, as compared to centralized exploration. as a result, a tradeoff exists between the short-term costs of decentralized exploration and the long-term benefits of reaching higher performance. as interactions across and within divisions increase, the optimal length of decentralized exploration tends to grow. paralleling our first result, we further show that even if a decision problem is decomposable, that is, can be perfectly modularized, it can be beneficial to create a temporary decision allocation that creates \\\"unnecessary\\\" interdependenciesacross the subsystems. this benefit arises in particular when the modules are complex by themselves. in both cases, an initial phase of exploration, enabled by an appropriate organizational structure, followed by refinement and coordination, enabled by a different structure, leads to high performance. to illustrate our general model, we focus on incumbent firms' responses to the internet and discuss implications for the product design process.\",\"data-driven design: the new challenges of digitalization on product design and development. digitalization and the momentous role being assumed by data are commonly viewed as pervasive phenomena whose impact is felt in all aspects of society and the economy. design activity is by no means immune from this trend, and the relationship between digitalization and design is decades old. however, what is the current impact of this 'data revolution' on design? how will the design activity change? what are the resulting research questions of interest to academics? what are the main challenges for firms and for educational institutions having to cope with this change? the paper provides a comprehensive conceptual framework, based on recent literature and anecdotal evidence from the industry. it identifies three main streams: namely the consequences on designers, the consequences on design processes and the role of methods for data analytics. in turn, these three streams lead to implications at individual, organizational and managerial level, and several questions arise worthy of defining future research agendas. moreover, the paper introduces relational diagrams depicting the interactions between the objects and the actors involved in the design process and suggests that what is occurring is by no means a simple evolution but a paradigmatic shift in the way artefacts are designed.\",\"metaverse as a driver for customer experience and value co-creation: implications for hospitality and tourism management and marketing. purpose: metaverse blends the physical and virtual worlds, revolutionizing how hospitality customers and hospitality organizations facilitate the co-creation of transformational experiences and values. this paper aims to explore the opportunities and challenges that metaverse introduces for hospitality and tourism management and marketing as part of the customer experience and value co-creation process. this paper also discusses how the advent and development of metaverse can potentially transform hospitality customer experience and value co-creation. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a comprehensive literature review was undertaken to explore conceptual developments on metaverse and best practice examples from around the world. findings: metaverse not only opens many exciting opportunities for hospitality and tourism but also poses some great challenges. hospitality and tourism organizations need to use the metaverse strategically to customize and co-create hybrid virtual and physical experiences, allowing consumers to engage with them and also with other customers before, during and after their visit. a range of research opportunities also emerge for the adoption and operationalization of metaverse. research limitations\\u002fimplications: this paper critically analyzes the early applications of metaverse in hospitality and tourism as well as promotes future solutions for hospitality and tourism management and marketing. the conceptual model in this study can help different stakeholders better understand the flow, logic and potential of metaverse in the hospitality and tourism industry. originality\\u002fvalue: the paper defines and conceptualizes the potential of metaverse in hospitality customer experience and value co-creation. besides putting forward a research agenda for further exploiting the full potential for both hospitality customers and hospitality organizations, this paper elucidates the impacts of metaverse on hospitality management, rooted in the previous literature in value co-creation and technology-enhanced experience.\",\"steal my idea! organizational adoption of user innovations from a user innovation community: a case study of dell ideastorm. open innovation models suggest that an organization's end users can be a potentially beneficial source for new ideas and innovations. however, incorporating end users raises some interesting challenges regarding how to balance the decision making power between a firm and the user community. using diffusion of innovation theory, we propose hypotheses based on the perceived attributes of end user ideas and end user promotion efforts. our findings suggest that the decision to adopt a user innovation was based on the ability of the firm to understand the technical requirements and respond to community concerns regarding the innovation.\",\"quantifying the impacts of energy inequality on carbon emissions in china: a household-level analysis. this study empirically investigates the impact of energy inequality on household carbon dioxide (co2) emissions in china by employing a balanced panel dataset for china's 30 provinces for the period 2000\\u20132017. fully considering the potential cross-sectional dependence, this study employs a series of empirical approaches allowing for cross-sectional dependence. moreover, given the significant differences in energy inequality and household co2 emissions, we further conduct an asymmetric analysis on the nexus between energy inequality and household co2 emissions. the empirical results indicate energy inequality can positively affect the volume of household co2 emissions; however, this finding makes no economic sense since it goes against the actual conditions in china (energy inequality and household co2 emissions have shown reverse change trends in recent years). simultaneously, we find that narrowing energy inequality can reduce the growth rate of co2 emissions, a fact we confirm with a series of robustness tests. notably, the impact of energy inequality on household co2 growth is asymmetric across various quantiles (i.e., different regions). accordingly, we highlight several relevant policy implications for the chinese government to reduce household co2 emissions and narrow energy inequality.\",\"intention to use analytical artificial intelligence (ai) in services \\u2013 the effect of technology readiness and awareness. purpose: the automation of services is rapidly growing, led by sectors such as banking and financial investment. the growing number of investments managed by artificial intelligence (ai) suggests that this technology-based service will become increasingly popular. this study examines how customers' technology readiness and service awareness affect their intention to use analytical ai investment services. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: hypotheses were tested with a data set of 404 north american-based potential customers of robo-advisors. in addition to technology readiness dimensions, the potential customers' characteristics were included in the framework as moderating factors (age, gender and previous experience with financial investment services). a post-hoc analysis examined the roles of service awareness and the financial advisor's name (i.e., robo-advisor vs. ai-advisor). findings: the results indicated that customers' technological optimism increases, and insecurity decreases, their intention to use robo-advisors. surprisingly, feelings of technological discomfort positively influenced robo-advisor adoption. this interesting finding challenges previous insights into technology adoption and value co-creation as analytical ai puts customers into a very passive role and reduces barriers to technology adoption. the research also analyzes how consumers become aware of robo-advisors, and how this influences their acceptance. originality\\u002fvalue: this is the first study to analyze the role of customers' technology readiness in the adoption of analytical ai. the authors link the findings to previous technology adoption and automated services' literature and provide specific managerial implications and avenues for further research.\",\"productivity and employment effects of digital complementarities. modern economic growth is no longer found in total factor productivity (tfp) because there are gains from technological change that are never recorded in the returns from innovation or in the national accounts. the existence of complementarities among technologies derived from the use of robotics, electronic commerce, or innovation is difficult to assess through country-level records. because the literature has mainly focused on robotisation at an aggregate or industry level, research focusing on a firm level and complementarities analysis have been limited. to fill the gap, in this paper, we intend to provide new evidence regarding the effects of robotisation, digitisation, and innovation on productivity and employment in firms, by using a large sample of 5511 spanish manufacturing firms for the period 1991\\u20132016. this data captures the payoff to the high rates of investment necessary to upgrade the production technology for firms in a new globally competitive framework.\",\"decision making in software architecture. traditionally, software architecture is seen as the result of the software architecture design process, the solution, usually represented by a set of components and connectors. recently, the why of the solution, the set of design decisions made by the software architect, is complementing or even replacing the solution-oriented definition of software architecture. this in turn leads to the study of the process of making these decisions. we outline some research directions that may help us understand and improve the software architecture design process.\",\"global sourcing strategy and sustainable competitive advantage. global sourcing strategy has been one of the most hotly debated management trends in the last 20 years. in its early years, global sourcing was examined mostly from \\\"in-house\\\" development and procurement perspectives; and in the last several years, research focus has shifted to \\\"outsourcing\\\" activities. along with this shift from internal to external focus on global sourcing, many researchers and business practitioners have applied a core competency argument to justify increased levels of outsourcing activities on a global basis. although the beneficial aspects of outsourcing are assumed in most cases, no consensus exists in reality as to the effect of outsourcing. furthermore, the increased instability of the exchange rate environment in the last several years has also led to increased difficulties in managing globally scattered operations that were once fashionable in the 1980s-90s under the rubric of global strategy. in this article, the authors explore potential limitations and negative consequences of outsourcing strategy on a global scale.\",\"artificial intelligence acceptance in services: connecting with generation z. this paper aims to examine willingness to accept artificial intelligence (ai) devices, focusing on the so-called gen z population. this study presumes that specific knowledge of a business process is important for ai adoption in hospitality services. a research model, grounded in the artificially intelligent device use acceptance (aidua) framework, used data collected from 786 respondents. the model was tested using pls-sem methodology. the modified framework was supported by gen z, with hedonic motivation having the greatest effect on gen z members\\u2019 emotions and their willingness to use ai devices in hospitality. the frequency of smartphone usage played a significant moderating role between the perceived effort of ai usage and emotions. this study helps ai designers and business managers when designing and implementing ai devices in a hospitality

old in sustainability transitions: technological alignment between fossil fuels and biofuels in norwegian coastal shipping. facing increasing pressure to decarbonize, innovation within the shipping sector has turned to low-and zero carbon solutions. in this paper we investigate how the development and implementation of biodiesel and liquefied biogas (lbg) in norwegian coastal shipping has been influenced by the technological alignment with fossil fuels. we understand this influence to emanate from the (mis)match of biofuels with the structure of coastal shipping (e.g. infrastructure, knowledge, institutions, actors) which has been shaped by fossil fuels. this way we contribute to the development of technological innovation systems (tis) framework by discussing the effect of sectoral cross-technology externalities on the functionality of a tis. our core data consists of semi-structured interviews, supported by a firm survey with norwegian shipowners. our results show that the technological alignment provides the biodiesel and lbg tiss with several benefits, such as access to established markets and infrastructure, which suggests that norway to some extent has good conditions for maritime biofuel markets to form. however, two major barriers for implementation of biofuels are fuel availability and cost. considering the competition with battery-electric and hydrogen solutions, the positive externalities of the interchangeability between fossil and biofuels are insufficient to make biodiesel and lbg competitive contenders for coastal shipping. in order to upscale implementation of biofuels in the norwegian coastal shipping sector, which is needed to reach national and international emission targets, there is a need for strengthened policy interventions. to establish market formation, subsidies for biofuels and feed-in targets would be crucial policy instruments.\",\"building supply-chain resilience: an artificial intelligence-based technique and decision-making framework. artificial intelligence (ai) offers a promising solution for building and promoting more resilient supply chains. however, the literature is highly dispersed regarding the application of ai in supply-chain management. the literature to date lacks a decision-making framework for identifying and applying powerful ai techniques to build supply-chain resilience (scres), curbing advances in research and practice on this interesting interface. in this paper, we propose an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) technique powered by ai-based algorithms such as fuzzy systems, wavelet neural networks (wnn) and evaluation based on distance from average solution (edas) to identify patterns in ai techniques for developing different scres strategies. the analysis was informed by data collected from 479 manufacturing companies to determine the most significant ai applications used for scres. the findings show that fuzzy logic programming, machine learning big data, and agent-based systems are the most promising techniques used to promote scres strategies. the study findings support decision-makers by providing an integrated decision-making framework to guide practitioners in ai deployment for building scres.\",\"usability and responsiveness of artificial intelligence chatbot on online customer experience in e-retailing. purpose: the rapid evolution in artificial intelligence (ai) has redefined the customer experience and created huge opportunities for companies to interact with customers using chatbots. this study explores the role of ai chatbots in influencing the online customer experience and customer satisfaction in e-retailing. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a research model based on the technology acceptance model and information system success model is proposed to describe the interrelationships among chatbot adoption, online customer experience and customer satisfaction. personality is a moderator in the model. the authors used a quantitative approach to collect 425 useable online questionnaires and statistical product and service solutions (spss) and smartpls to analyze the measurement model and proposed hypotheses. findings: the usability of the chatbot had a positive influence on extrinsic values of customer experience, whereas the responsiveness of the chatbot had a positive impact on intrinsic values of customer experience. furthermore, online customer experience had a positive relationship with customer satisfaction, and personality influenced the relationship between the usability of the chatbot and extrinsic values of customer experience. originality\\u002fvalue: this research extends understanding of the online customer experience with chatbots in e-retailing and provides empirical evidence by showing that extrinsic and intrinsic values of online customer experience are enhanced by chatbot adoption.\",\"effects of pros and cons of applying big data analytics to consumers' responses in an e-commerce context. the era of big data analytics has begun in most industries within developed countries. this new analytics tool has raised motivation for experts and researchers to study its impacts to business values and challenges. however, studies which help to understand customers' views and their behavior towards the applications of big data analytics are lacking. this research aims to explore and determine the pros and cons of applying big data analytics that affects customers' responses in an e-commerce environment. data analyses were conducted in a sample of 273 respondents from vietnam. the findings found that information search, recommendation system, dynamic pricing, and customer services had significant positive effects on customers' responses. privacy and security, shopping addiction, and group influences were found to have significant negative effects on customers' responses. customers' responses were measured at intention and behavior stages. moreover, positive and negative effects simultaneously presented significant effect on customers' responses. each dimension of positive and negative factors had different significant impacts on customers' intention and behavior. specifically, information search had a significant influence on customers' intention and improved customers' behavior. shopping addiction had a drastic change from intention to behavior compared to group influences and privacy and security. this study contributes to improve understanding of customers' responses under big data era. this could play an important role to develop sustainable consumers market. e-vendors can rely on big data analytics but over usage may have some negative applications.\",\"pricing privacy \\u2013 the right to know the value of your personal data. the commodification of digital identities is an emerging reality in the data-driven economy. personal data of individuals represent monetary value in the data-driven economy and are often considered a counter performance for \\u201cfree\\u201d digital services or for discounts for online products and services. furthermore, customer data and profiling algorithms are already considered a business asset and protected through trade secrets. at the same time, individuals do not seem to be fully aware of the monetary value of their personal data and tend to underestimate their economic power within the data-driven economy and to passively succumb to the propertization of their digital identity. an effort that can increase awareness of

their personal data, they can acquire higher awareness about their power in the digital market and thus be effectively empowered for the protection of their information privacy. this paper analyzes whether consumers\\u002fusers should have a right to know the value of their personal data. after analyzing how eu legislation is already developing in the direction of propertization and monetization of personal data, different models for quantifying the value of personal data are investigated. these models are discussed, not to determine the actual prices of personal data, but to show that the monetary value of personal data can be quantified, a conditio-sine-qua-non for the right to know the value of your personal data. next, active choice models, in which users are offered the option to pay for online services, either with their personal data or with money, are discussed. it is concluded, however, that these models are incompatible with eu data protection law. finally, practical, moral and cognitive problems of pricing privacy are discussed as an introduction to further research. we conclude that such research is needed to see to which extent these problems can be solved or mitigated. only then, it can be determined whether the benefits of introducing a right to know the value of your personal data outweigh the problems and hurdles related to it.\",\"drivers for and barriers to low-energy buildings in sweden. from the perspective of construction companies, this paper investigates the existence and significance of barriers and driving forces for the implementation of energy-efficient houses in sweden. here, eleven construction companies that build low-energy buildings comparable in performance with passive houses have been interviewed. one conclusion is that there is not one specific barrier that keeps energy-efficient housing from taking off. instead, the barriers include a whole range of issues that have to be considered. internal pressure has been a strong contributor to the onset of passive house constructions within the companies and the results indicate that personal commitment is central and perhaps the strongest driver. a general reflection from the interviews is that there is a need to show both construction companies and potential customers that it is possible to build passive houses and that they exist. unlike the national building regulations, which are not considered to be relevant when it comes to energy consumption, the future building regulations from the european union are identified as a regulatory driver. moreover, life-cycle thinking is reported to increase among actors, but that it would be beneficial if banks as well as real estate agents could develop a comprehensive view and become better at considering energy and lcc in their capital budgeting templates. even if the interest for passive houses is considered low among the public, the market is identified as promising among the construction companies - recently actually large enough to become a driver in itself.\",\"value creation for realising the sustainable development goals: fostering organisational adoption of big data analytics. the momentum has been building toward the realisation of the united nations development programme's sustainable development goals (sdgs). in this regard, technological upgrading through the adoption of innovative technologies, as in big data analytics (bda), can be seen as a key enabler of helping to address societal challenges. while there is some evidence for realising value created from bda adoption, organisational issues associated with societal challenges, specifically those targeting the sdgs, are yet to be appreciated. this study utilises a technology\\u2013organisation\\u2013environment framework to examine the role of top management support in facilitating value creation from bda adoption for the realisation sdgs. based on a survey of 320 uk managers, this study found that the technological driver of bda coupled with top management support, can significantly help in the adoption process. therefore, crafting the value needed for effectively supporting the realisation of these goals.\",\"extending a tam\\u2013ttf model with perceptions toward telematics adoption. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to examine a framework integrating the technology acceptance model (tam), individuals\\u2019 task\\u2013technology fit (ttf) and perceptions toward adopting automobile telematics devices. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this study integrated the tam with ttf to understand individual perceptions of a technology\\u2019s value. in addition, the intrinsic motivational factors toward technology usage, including positive perceptions (perceived enjoyment, personal innovation and perceived uniqueness) and negative perceptions (perceived risk and performance gap), were considered in the model. furthermore, the moderating effect of driving experience was examined. findings: the perceived usefulness (pu) of telematics as well as perceived ease of use (peou) affected drivers\\u2019 adoption intentions. peou had a greater effect on adoption intentions than pu, and technology characteristics had a greater effect on ttf than task characteristics. moreover, individuals\\u2019 perceptions of perceived enjoyment and uniqueness affected pu and peou. the negative perceptions of perceived risk and performance gap affected pu and peou, respectively. furthermore, driving experience significantly weakened the relationship between pu and intentions. originality\\u002fvalue: telematics is a niche market due to the development of the internet of things, but users\\u2019 adoption intentions remain unknown. this study constructed a more comprehensive model and tested the impacts of certain variables on telematics adoption, with driving experience as a crucial moderator.\",\"the next wave of digital technological change and the cultural industries. in this proposal of a research agenda for cultural economics, i discuss the supply-side economics of the next wave of digital technological change. i begin by arguing that digitization and internet-enabled platforms, together with automated licensing of user-generated content, have substantially lowered the costs of individual-level cultural participation. i discuss how the dependence on advertising revenues may affect this dynamic and highlight some implications for the economics of copyright. next, i discuss circumstances under which market data, which have become much less expensive to collect at more fine-grained levels, can trigger differentiation of cultural products. finally, i speculate about the economic implications of artificial intelligence that complements, or perhaps substitutes for human creativity with regard to cultural participation, copyright and the industrial organization of culture.\",\"a study on the role of web 4.0 and 5.0 in the sustainable tourism ecosystem of ho chi minh city, vietnam. this research discusses the role of web 4.0 and 5.0 devices on the commercial sustainability for tourism in ho chi minh city (hcmc), vietnam. the study adopts a tourist perspective regarding the future implementation of web 4.0 and 5.0 devices, focusing on the service quality of various tourism-associated services and assessing, in return, the extent to which the overall satisfaction and long-term patronage of tourists is affected. usually, researchers conduct this test in various popular establishments where devices are intended for experimental use and tourists are supposed to have previous exposure to them, so that their perceptual thinking regarding the service quality of these devices can be studied. the tourists act as respondents for various establishments. we also asked subjective questions in a short interview to 10 professionals working in these establishments, which helped us in the quantitative survey process. as a mixed method study, it has covered both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the items and provided a holistic result. the results indicated thatweb 4.0 and 5.0, along with the service quality offered by personnel working in the establishments, showed significant variance in holistic service evaluation for tourist satisfaction and loyalty. very few service quality factors had a distinct variance in the output. after using a regression analysis for web 4.0 and 5.0 devices and service quality, we found that web 4.0 and 5.0 showed insignificant negative results. this study contributes to the incremental research on web 1.0 to 5.0, specifically detailing how it affects tourists' satisfaction and patronage. moreover, from a management point of view, this study can help solve the financial riddle of various establishments in hcmcs tourism ecosystem for optimum fund management and better productivity.\",\"augmenting the algorithm: emerging human-in-the-loop work configurations. how do configurations of humans and algorithms evolve as firms adopt artificial intelligence (ai) capabilities, and what are the implications for work and organization? we explored these questions through a two-year long case study of an organization in the international maritime trade that introduced automated algorithmic support for data analysis and prediction work. drawing on a human\\u2013machine configuration perspective, we found that humans and the algorithm were configured and reconfigured in multiple ways over time as the organization dealt with the introduction of algorithmic analysis. in contrast to replacing human work, the emergent configurations required new roles and redistribution of extant expertise to augment and improve the accuracy of the algorithm. our analysis suggests that the new configuration resembled a human-in-the-loop pattern, comprised of both the augmentation work of auditing (i.e. the generation of a ground truth and assessment of the algorithmic output against this) as well as the work of altering the algorithm and the data acquisition architecture. our research points to the strategic importance of a human-in-the-loop pattern for organizational reflexivity to ensure that the performance of the algorithm meets the organization's requirements and changes in the environment.\",\"the design thinking approaches of three different groups of designers based on self-reports. this paper compares the design thinking approaches of three groups of student-designers: industrial design and architecture undergraduates, and design phd candidates. participants responded to an open-ended design brief, working individually. upon submission of their designs they were debriefed about their design processes. we compare the groups based on their submissions and self-reported design activities, especially the sequence of their design activities and the time allotted to them. there were some commonalities and differences between the two undergraduate groups but the main differences were between the two undergraduates and the phd students. on the basis of the findings we pose questions regarding design methods in the era of 'design thinking' wherein designers are required to adopt an entrepreneurial frame of mind.\",\"chatgpt and a new academic reality: artificial intelligence-written research papers and the ethics of the large language models in scholarly publishing. this article discusses openai's chatgpt, a generative pre-trained transformer, which uses natural language processing to fulfill text-based user requests (i.e., a \\u201cchatbot\\u201d). the history and principles behind chatgpt and similar models are discussed. this technology is then discussed in relation to its potential impact on academia and scholarly research and publishing. chatgpt is seen as a potential model for the automated preparation of essays and other types of scholarly manuscripts. potential ethical issues that could arise with the emergence of large language models like gpt-3, the underlying technology behind chatgpt, and its usage by academics and researchers, are discussed and situated within the context of broader advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing for research and scholarly publishing.\",\"technology adoption: a conjoint analysis of consumers' preference on future online banking services. abstract the importance of service delivery technology and online service adoption and usage in the banking industry has received an increased discussion in the literature in recent years. owing to the fact that strong online banking services are important drivers for bank performance and customer service delivery; several studies have been carried out on online banking service adoption or acceptance where services are already deployed and on the factors that influence customers' adoption and use or intention to use those services. however, despite the increasing discussion in the literatures, no attempt has been made to look at consumers' preference in terms of future online banking service adoption. this study used conjoint analysis and stated preference methods with discrete choice model to analyze the technology adoption pattern regarding consumers' preference for potential future online banking services in the nigerian banking industry. the result revealed that to increase efficiency and strengthen competitiveness, banks need to promote smart and practical branded services especially self-services at the same time promote a universal adoption of e-banking system services that add entertainment or extra convenience to customers such as ease of usage including digital wallet, real-time interaction (video banking), atms integrated

transformation of industrial firms: an innovation diffusion perspective. purpose: the digitization process has increased the pressure on large firms to transform. however, current frameworks on digital transformation are not well explaining what factors contribute to, or hinder, a firm's digital transformation. innovation diffusion theories could complement existing frameworks, and for this reason, the purpose of this paper is to expand the existing body of knowledge on what contributes to, or hinders, an industrial firm's digital transformation by applying a validated framework based on innovation diffusion theories on two pioneer cases: general electric and siemens ehr\\u002fhealth services. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the framework used in this paper is based on several years' empirical studies and iterative literature reviews on innovation diffusion theories. further, each use case is based on literature reviews and unique empirical data, collected by the authors of this paper as a result of taking active part of respective company's multi-years transformation. findings: common drivers of, and clear inhibitors to the two firms' transformation, were identified. the innovation diffusion framework was found to work very well in identifying those factors. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the implications are that researchers better can analyze\\u002fexplain a digital transformation of a firm, and business managers can better plan or improve their firms' transformation processes. originality\\u002fvalue: the theoretical contributions of this paper are two: first, complement existing frameworks with a validated framework for innovation diffusion; second, provide an extension of our body of knowledge on factors that contributes to, or hinders, industrial firm's digital transformation.\",\"business value of big data analytics: a systems-theoretic approach and empirical test. although big data analytics have been widely considered a key driver of marketing and innovation processes, whether and how big data analytics create business value has not been fully understood and empirically validated at a large scale. taking social media analytics as an example, this paper is among the first attempts to theoretically explain and empirically test the market performance impact of big data analytics. drawing on the systems theory, we explain how and why social media analytics create super-additive value through the synergies in functional complementarity between social media diversity for gathering big data from diverse social media channels and big data analytics for analyzing the gathered big data. furthermore, we deepen our theorizing by considering the difference between small and medium enterprises (smes) and large firms in the required integration effort that enables the synergies of social media diversity and big data analytics. in line with this theorizing, we empirically test the synergistic effect of social media diversity and big data analytics by using a recent large-scale survey data set from 18,816 firms in italy. we find that social media diversity and big data analytics have a positive interaction effect on market performance, which is more salient for smes than for large firms.\",\"smes and digital transformation during a crisis: the emergence of resilience as a second-order dynamic capability in an entrepreneurial ecosystem. in this research, we examine how small and medium enterprises (smes) build their resilience capability during a crisis, through the adoption of digital technologies. utilizing a qualitative approach grounded in case studies of eight entrepreneurs from india who had to radically change their business models and operations during the covid-19 pandemic, we develop a multilevel model of resilience capability: at the micro (entrepreneur), meso (organizational), and macro (entrepreneurial ecosystem) levels. in developing resilience, the smes alternate their focus: from concentrating on the core to moving toward the periphery of their organizational boundaries, highlighting a shifting play of the three first-order dynamic capabilities of sensing, seizing, and transforming. by affording smes an opportunity to transform themselves by embracing digital technologies, the crisis leads to the emergence of resilience capability as a second-order dynamic capability.\",\"big data for business management in the retail industry. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to shed light on how big data deployment transforms organizational practices, thereby generating potential benefits, in a specific industry: retail. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: to achieve the paper\\u2019s goal, the authors have conducted several semi-structured interviews with marketing managers of four retailers in italy, and researched secondary data to get a broader picture of big data deployment in the organizations. findings: data analysis helped identify specific aspects related to big data deployment, data gathering methods, required competences and data sharing approaches. originality\\u002fvalue: despite the growing interest in big data in various fields of research, there are still few empirical studies on big data deployment in organizations in the management field, and even fewer on specific sectors. this research provides evidence of specific areas of analysis concerning big data in the retail industry.\",\"cashing in on innovation: a taxonomy of fintech. in this article, we provide a taxonomy of the different types of innovation occurring in financial services, a framework which we refer to as our fintech ecosystem. we use this fintech ecosystem to highlight the various areas of potential value for investors who are looking into ventures in this space as alternative investments. our conceptual framework enables investors to examine emerging technologies and fintech verticals through the lens of a sector analysis. to better understand where the fintech revolution started and where it is going, we apply the concept of digital transformation to the financial services industry which allows us to highlight the delicate risk-reward balance in fintech.\",\"are firms ready to use big data analytics to create value? the role of structural and psychological readiness. in this study, we leverage information technology (it) readiness literature and resource-based view (rbv) to investigate the impact of firm structural and psychological readiness on firm value creation, as mediated by big data analytics usage. the proposed research model is empirically validated using survey data from 179 senior it managers. the findings demonstrate the importance of both structural (i.e. it infrastructure capability, tools functionality, employee analytical capability, and bigness of data) and psychological readiness (i.e. it proactive climate) in enhancing firm value creation through big data analytics usage. these results provide interesting theoretical and practical insights.\",\"big data and performance: what can management research tell us?. the special issue focuses on the theory and evidence linking the use of big data related technologies by businesses with their performance. here we connect the papers accepted for the special issue to the overarching theme of big data as an emerging concept within the business management literature. we present two prominent case studies examining the use big data technologies on performance and strategy, followed by a discussion on how themes around big data and performance may be examined from a theoretical perspective. finally, based on a synthesis of papers in the current issue, we discuss the emerging issues and trends within the academic literature, relevant for future research.\",\"the use of resources in resource acquisition. the author considers the processes through which a firm can acquire resources and argues that its current stock of resources create asymmetries in competition for new resources. two simple models illustrate how this can work through linkages on the demand and\\u002for cost side. the normative implication is that firms should expand their resource portfolios by building on their existing resources; different firms will then acquire different new resources, and small initial heterogeneities will amplify over time.\",\"towards innovation in living labs networks. this paper focuses on living labs that are open user-centred environments for networked innovation development. although the concept of open innovation has quickly attracted both the scientific and applied communities, research on living labs is scarce, and literature lacks understanding of the characteristics of the living labs model. we aim to describe what the living labs are from the innovation network perspective. using a case study of a regional living labs initiative, we describe the key participants and their roles in the living labs network. in addition, we discuss their motives to participate in the network, as well as the outcomes and perceived challenges of innovation co-creation. according to our findings, living labs are a practical way of encouraging open innovation. they are dedicated inter-organisational environments that provide pertinent support for concurrent engineering's (ce) networked processes. the integration of users as co-producers in product development is imperative for success in the living labs model because it reveals their latent needs and enables unforeseen outcomes. copyright\",\"digitainability: the combined effects of the megatrends digitalization and sustainability. the concept of digitainability has recently been suggested to underscore potential cross-fertilization effects between digitalization and sustainability, which have often been neglected. this conceptual article draws on an innovation-based view to develop a framework for combining digitalization and sustainability in firms' strategic initiatives. it distinguishes four settings depending on whether firms pursue either digitalization or sustainability - or both or none of them to a strong degree. beyond the individual importance of the two megatrends, their positive and negative interdependencies will gain further importance, and this article underscores the need for overcoming a potential dark side of digital solutions in terms of their carbon footprint and energy consumption to enable a sustainable digital transformation. in addition, digitainability offers the opportunity to move beyond optimization and cost savings due to digitalization and sustainability initiatives in order to capture the cross-fertilization potential of these two megatrends for innovation, business development, and sustainable design.\",\"big data analytics capability and decision-making: the role of data-driven insight on circular economy performance. big data analytics (bda) is a revolutionary approach for sound decision-making in organizations that can lead to remarkable changes in transforming and supporting the circular economy (ce). however, extant literature on bda capability has paid limited attention to understanding the enabling role of data-driven insights for supporting decision-making and, consequently, enhancing ce performance. we argue that firms drive decision-making quality through data-driven insights, business intelligence and analytics (bi&a), and bda capability. in this study, we empirically investigated the association of bda capability with ce performance and examined the mediating role of data-driven insights in the relationship between bda capability and decision-making. data were collected from 109 czech manufacturing firms, and partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the data. the results reveal that bda capability and bi&a are positively associated with decision-making quality. this effect is stronger when the manufacturer utilizes data-driven insights. the results demonstrate that bda capability drives decision-making quality in organizations, and data-driven insights do not mediate this relationship. bi&a is associated with decision-making quality through data-driven insights. these findings offer important insights to managers, as they can act as a reference point for developing data-driven insights with the ce paradigm in organizations.\",\"spatial implications of digitization: state of the field and research agenda. digitization is an influential megatrend that is quickly and comprehensively transforming economic spaces worldwide. its disruptive power has not yet been fully developed but, despite a lack of topical empirical or theoretical research, it nevertheless seems clear that it will significantly affect the economic order within and between economic spaces and places. currently, digitization is high on the policy agenda in many countries. several related programs and initiatives combine expansion and improvement of digital infrastructure with efforts to reduce spatial economic inequality and to facilitate a general catch-up process for lagging (often rural) regions. however, the idea that digitization can reduce spatial inequality remains highly controversial. this study aims to focus on the economic geography implications of digitization and to enrich the existing literature in two ways. first, the study overviews the state of research on the spatial consequences of digitization. deploying a comprehensive literature review, this section discusses the primary theoretical and empirical results from two contradictory narratives on the ability of digitization to reinforce the death of distance and thus reduce spatial inequality. second, we develop a research agenda concerning select fields of research that could appropriately be addressed in the future by economic geographers. these fields include spatial economic digitization effects, digital competencies, entrepreneurial activities, and innovation activities in both urban and rural regions. closing the research gaps would contribute to the development of much-needed policy measures.\",\"enlightening the dynamic capabilities of design thinking in fostering digital transformation. digital transformation describes the deep-seated changes in organizational activities, processes, and capabilities induced by the advent of digital technologies. digital transformation requires sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring the digital technological challenges into opportunities. academic literature acknowledges the central role of design as a driver of innovation. furthermore, recent research discloses the value that design, especially design thinking, can have in leading digital transformations. in this understanding, design thinking has been proven to be an approach based on dynamic capabilities. what seems to lack in the current understanding is how the dynamic capabilities of design thinking can facilitate digital transformation. thus, the paper aims to shed light on how dynamic capabilities of design thinking foster discovering the opportunities digital technologies provide to enact the transformation. this paper investigates four different cases of consulting projects where the adoption of design thinking dynamic capabilities enhance the value of digital technologies towards a more human centric digital transformation. by being a business-to-business market, the consulting environment might inform readers how design thinking dynamic capabilities are salient for digital transformation. examining them, the paper proposes five design thinking dynamic capabilities that managers should cultivate: extending, debating, cropping, interpreting, and recombining. concerning academic debate, the paper enriches the understanding of digital transformation by unshadowing the value that design thinking dynamic capabilities might play in it.\",\"big data, big data analytics capability, and sustainable innovation performance. literature suggests that big data is a new competitive advantage and that it enhance organizational performance. yet, previous empirical research has provided conflicting results. building on the resource-based view and the organizational inertia theory, we develop a model to investigate how big data and big data analytics capability affect innovation success. we show that there is a trade-offbetween big data and big data analytics capability and that optimal balance of big data depends upon levels of big data analytics capability. we conduct a four-year empirical research project to secure empirical data on 1109 data-driven innovation projects from the united states and china. this research is the first time reporting the empirical results. the study findings reveal several surprising results that challenge traditional views of the importance of big data in innovation. for u.s. innovation projects, big data has an inverted u-shaped relationship with sales growth. big data analytics capability exerts a positive moderating effect, that is, the stronger this capability is, the greater the impact of big data on sales growth and gross margin. for chinese innovation projects, when big data resource is low, promoting big data analytics capability increases sales growth and gross margin up to a certain point; developing big data analytics capability beyond that point may actually inhibit innovation performance. our findings provide guidance to firms on making strategic decisions regarding resource allocations for big data and big data analytics capability.\",\"exploring the relationship between big data analytics capability and competitive performance: the mediating roles of dynamic and operational capabilities. a central question for information systems (is) researchers and practitioners is if, and how, big data can help attain a competitive advantage. to address this question, this study draws on the resource-based view, dynamic capabilities view, and on recent literature on big data analytics, and examines the indirect relationship between a firm's big data analytics capability (bdac) and competitive performance. the study extends existing research by proposing that bdacs enable firms to generate insight that can help strengthen their dynamic capabilities, which, in turn, positively impact marketing and technological capabilities. to test our proposed research model, we used survey data from 202 chief information officers and it managers working in norwegian firms. by means of partial least squares structural equation modeling, results show that a strong bdac can help firms build a competitive advantage. this effect is not direct but fully mediated by dynamic capabilities, which exerts a positive and significant effect on two types of operational capabilities: marketing and technological capabilities. the findings suggest that is researchers should look beyond direct effects of big data investments and shift their attention on how a bdac can be leveraged to enable and support organizational capabilities.\",\"commercializing inventions resulting from university research: analyzing the impact of technology characteristics on subsequent business models. one of the key challenges in commercializing inventions arising from academic research is deciding on an appropriate business model for transferring the invention from the academic world to the commercial world. however, there is little empirical evidence to suggest which model to choose. this study attempts to address this gap by examining how characteristics of technologies affect the selection of business models. we consider four characteristics of technology: patent or other legal protection, specialized complementary assets, commercial uncertainty and technological dynamism. we relate these characteristics to the choice of three basic business models for commercializing inventions. data for this study were gathered for 42 commercialized inventions. we found evidence that greater patent or other legal protection for the technology was associated with a greater likelihood that the technology was commercialized by transferring limited rights to the technology to existing firms. we also found evidence that greater commercial uncertainty was associated with a greater likelihood that the technology was commercialized by creation of a new firm or transfer of the rights to the technology to an existing firm. we did not find evidence of a relationship between the importance of specialized complementary assets or technological dynamism and the business model used.\",\"make your travel smarter: summarizing urban tourism information from massive blog data. in this work, we propose a research framework to help people summarize tourism information, such as popular tourist locations as well as their travel sequences (routes), for a previously unknown city from massive travel blog with the objective of providing users with better travel scheduling. to do this, we first crawl the massive travel blogs for a targeted city online. then, we transfer the textual contents of these blogs to a series of word vectors to form the initial data source. next, we implement the frequent pattern mining method on the data to identify the city's popular locations by their sequenced co-occurrences among the usual tourism activities, which can be visualized into a word network. finally, we develop a max-confidence based method to detect travel routes from the network. we illustrate the benefits of this approach by applying it to the data from a blog web-site run by a chinese online tourism service company. the results show that the proposed method can efficiently explore the popular travel information from massive data.\",\"big data facilitation, utilization, and monetization: exploring the 3vs in a new product development process. big data is transforming the new product development (npd) process. organizations are investing heavily in big data capabilities to capitalize on the ongoing analytics movement. yet there is a lack of understanding of how firms can leverage big data as a capability to generate innovation success in dynamic marketplaces. to address this need for improved insights, the authors operationalize and analyze the 3vs of big data usage\\u2014volume, variety, and velocity\\u2014in an npd model. drawing on the results of a survey of 261 managers reporting on their business unit's npd processes and big data usage, this study identifies the antecedents of the multidimensional usage of big data. empirically assessing the effects of firm orientations, the authors show that an exploration orientation has a positive effect on all three dimensions of a firm's big data usage while an exploitation orientation has no effect. moving downstream, the results also reveal that the environmental factor of customer turbulence interacts differentially with the big data usage dimensions' impact on new product revenue (npr). specifically, customer turbulence accentuates the relationship between big data velocity and npr but attenuates the relationship between big data volume and npr.\",\"how and when do big data investments pay off? the role of marketing affordances and service innovation. big data technologies and analytics enable new digital services and are often associated with superior performance. however, firms investing in big data often fail to attain those advantages. to answer the questions of how and when big data pay off, marketing scholars need new theoretical approaches and empirical tools that account for the digitized world. building on affordance theory, the authors develop a novel, conceptually rigorous, and practice-oriented framework of the impact of big data investments on service innovation and performance. affordances represent action possibilities, namely what individuals or organizations with certain goals and capabilities can do with a technology. the authors conceptualize and operationalize three important big data marketing affordances: customer behavior pattern spotting, real-time market responsiveness, and data-driven market ambidexterity. the empirical analysis establishes construct validity and offers a preliminary nomological test of direct, indirect, and conditional effects of big data marketing affordances on perceived big data performance.\",\"a state-of-the-art review of the sharing economy: scientometric mapping of the scholarship. using a dataset of 2,229 scholarly outputs from the web of science on the sharing economy (se), our scientometric review provides a taxonomy of the current research on the se in terms of their contributions, theories, and methods utilized in existing studies. the review also highlights a typology of the inter-related concepts of the se. we demonstrate four clusters of existing research: freelance work and its implications, transportation and solutions for the sustainable development of the se, user experience and collaborative consumption, and the se in the context of hospitality and tourism. we suggest future research directions in terms of the need to investigate the se implications on a wider set of stakeholders including businesses and governments, to examine the se value creation in terms of business models and entrepreneurship, to investigate the se in other industries and sectors, and to conduct large-scale empirical studies in this research domain.\",\"reshaping competitive advantages with analytics capabilities in service systems. big data analytics capability can reshape competitive advantages for a service system. however, little is known about how to develop and operationalize a service system analytics capability (ssac) model. drawing on the resource based view (rbv), dynamic capability theory (dct) and the emerging literature on big data analytics, this study develops and validates an ssac model and frames its impact on competitive advantages using a thematic analysis, delphi studies (n=35) and a survey (n=251). the main findings illuminate the varying importance of three primary dimensions (i.e., service system analytics management capability, technology capability and personnel capability) and various respective subdimensions (i.e., service system planning, investment, coordination, control, connectivity, compatibility, modularity, technology management knowledge, technical knowledge, business knowledge and relationship knowledge) in developing overall analytics capabilities for a service system. the findings also confirm the strong mediating effects of three dynamic capabilities (i.e., market sensing, seizing and reconfiguring) in establishing competitive advantages. we critically discuss the implications of our findings for theory, methods and practice with limitations and future research directions.\",\"data analytics supports decentralized innovation. data-analytics technology can accelerate the innovation process by enabling existing knowledge to be identified, accessed, combined, and deployed to address new problem domains. however, like prior advances in information technology, the ability of firms to exploit these opportunities depends on a variety of complementary human capital and organizational capabilities. we focus on whether analytics is more valuable in firms where innovation within a firm has decentralized groups of inventors or centralized ones. our analysis draws on prior work measuring firm-analytics capability using detailed employee-level data and matches these data to metrics on intrafirm inventor networks that reveal whether a firm\\u2019s innovation structure is centralized or decentralized. in a panel of 1,864 publicly traded firms from the years 1988\\u20132013, we find that firms with a decentralized innovation structure have a greater demand for analytics skills and receive greater productivity benefits from their analytics capabilities, consistent with a complementarity between analytics and decentralized innovation. we also find that analytics helps decentralized structures to create new combinations and reuse of existing technologies, consistent with the ability of analytics to link knowledge across diverse domains and to integrate external knowledge into the firm. furthermore, the effect primarily comes from the analytics capabilities of the noninventor employees as opposed to inventors themselves. these results show that the benefit of analytics on innovation depends on existing organizational structures. similar to the it\\u2013productivity paradox, these results can help explain a contemporary analytics\\u2013innovation paradox\\u2014the apparent slowdown in innovation despite the recent increase in analytics investments.\",\"business analytics: radical shift or incremental change?. business analytics systems are seen by many to be a growing source of value and competitive advantage for businesses. however, it is not clear if increasingly advanced analytical capabilities create opportunities for radical change in business or just represent an incremental improvement to existing systems. what are the key questions that researchers should be focusing on to improve our understanding of analytics? and are information systems (is) programs teaching students the right things to be successful in this environment? this panel at international conference on information systems (icis) 2012 took stock of technological possibilities, practical experience and leading research to assess the current state and future direction of business analytics. in doing so, it brought together senior researchers and industry representatives to share the leading challenges, opportunities and good practice that they see.\",\"an integrated artificial intelligence framework for knowledge creation and b2b marketing rational decision making for improving firm performance. this study examines the effect of big data powered artificial intelligence on customer knowledge creation, user knowledge creation and external market knowledge creation to better understand its impact on b2b marketing rational decision making to influence firm performance. the theoretical model is grounded in knowledge management theory (kmt) and the primary data was collected from b2b companies functioning in the south african mining industry. findings point out that big data powered artificial intelligence and the path customer knowledge creation is significant. secondly, big data powered artificial intelligence and the path user knowledge creation is significant. thirdly, big data powered artificial intelligence and the path external market knowledge creation is significant. it was observed that customer knowledge creation, user knowledge creation and external market knowledge creation have significant effect on the b2b marketing-rational decision making. finally, the path b2b marketing rational decision making has a significant effect on firm performance.\",\"information technology management domain: emerging themes and keyword analysis. by employing the social network analysis technique, this study decomposed author and title keyword networks of the information technology management domain formed by 351 outlets, 914 institutions, 64 countries, 1913 authors, and thousands of keywords. the network and ego level properties\\u2014such as, degree centralities, density, components, and degree distribution\\u2014suggest that the keyword network exhibits power law distribution: a few popular keywords or themes are frequently used by follow-on studies. the study sheds light on the emerging and fading themes in the domain. in light of the analysis some important implications are discussed.\",\"the shift to socio-organizational drivers of business intelligence and analytics acceptance. the growing importance of it in new ways of doing business, bringing with it ever greater empowerment, competencies, and skills of people associated with it use, reveals that traditional views that individuals decide to accept new or emerging it mostly based on their effort and performance perceptions or a similar individualistic utilitarian criteria may no longer satisfactorily explain the individual's acceptance behavior. socio-organizational considerations encompassing normative and behavioral beliefs have so far only been recognized as potential additional predictors of acceptance, moderated, or mediated by certain effects and circumstances, whereas performance perceptions remain the strongest predictor of is acceptance. the authors' mixed-methods study drives acceptance in the business intelligence and analytics (bi&a) context, comprising literature review, case studies and a survey, which reveals socio-organizational considerations have become more important than individualistic considerations arising from the visibility and recognition of the results of bi&a use in an organization. copyright\",\"antecedents to firm performance and competitiveness using the lens of big data analytics: a cross-cultural study. purpose: the study aims to understand how big data analytics capabilities of tech startups help them gain competitive advantage and improve their firm performance. the study is performed for two countries: india and china. a comparative analysis is also discussed in the study. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the study collected responses from tech startups from both india and china. a total of 502 responses were collected with 269 from india and 233 from china. the results were analyzed using warp pls 6.0 after testing for common method bias, endogeneity and reliability of data. the study tested five primary hypotheses and also tested the effect of two control variables: country of origin of startup and age of the startup. findings: we found that big data analytics capabilities have a positive and significant impact on the firm performance and competitive advantage of tech startups. while organizational culture proved to have a positive impact as a moderator, innovation was found to have non-significant effect. the results also found to have non-significant effect of age of the firm while its country of origin does play an important role in defining its success. originality\\u002fvalue: the study offer key insights for the tech startups operating in two countries which are geographically neighbors but differ in the tech expertise from each other. moreover, the study offers key insights on how does the origin of the country contributes significantly to explaining the success and competitiveness of the firm.\",\"research streams on digital transformation from a holistic business perspective: a systematic literature review and citation network analysis. digital transformation (dt) has become a buzzword, triggering different disciplines in research and influencing practice, which leads to independent research streams. scholars investigate the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of these disruptive technologies by examining the use of single technologies or of digitization, in general. approaches are often very specialized and restricted to their domains. thus, the immense breadth of technologies and their possible applications conditions a fragmentation of research, impeding a holistic view. with this systematic literature review, we aim to fill this gap in providing an overview of the different disciplines of dt research from a holistic business perspective. we identified the major research streams and clustered them with co-citation network analysis in nine main areas. our research shows the main fields of interest in digital transformation research, overlaps of the research areas and fields that are still underrepresented. within the business research areas, we identified three dominant areas in literature: finance, marketing, and innovation management. however, research streams also arise in terms of single branches like manufacturing or tourism. this study highlights these diverse research streams with the aim of deepening the understanding of digital transformation in research. yet, research on dt still lacks in the areas of accounting, human resource management, and sustainability. the findings were distilled into a framework of the nine main areas for assisting the implications on potential research gaps on dt from a business perspective.\",\"cloud computing adoption and its impact on smes\\u2019 performance for cloud supported operations: a dual-stage analytical approach. this paper investigates the key predictors of cloud computing adoption, and further, assesses how cloud computing adoption affects small and medium enterprises' (smes') performance. to test the proposed model, we have applied a dual-stage analytical approach by combining structural equation modeling (sem) and artificial neural network (ann). sem results reveal that relative advantage, service quality, perceived risks, top management supports, facilitating conditions, cloud providers influence, server location, computer self-efficacy, and resistance to change have a significant effect on the adoption of cloud computing. also, this study confirms the positive impact of cloud computing adoption on firm performance. the results of importance-performance map analysis (ipma) suggest that managerial actions should focus more on improving perceived risk, relative advantage, and top management support. besides, the results of neural network analysis indicate that the most significant predictor of cloud adoption is server location followed by facilitating conditions, relative advantage, service quality, top management support, computer self-efficacy, perceived risks, cloud provider's influence, and resistance to change. we also discuss the implications of the research that can assist researchers, owners\\u002fmanagers, policymakers, and cloud providers by offering valuable insights regarding cloud computing adoption in smes.\",\"co-evolution of platform architecture, platform services, and platform governance: expanding the platform value of industrial digital platforms. industrial manufacturers increasingly develop digital platforms in the business-to-business (b2b) context. this emergent form of digital platforms requires a profound yet little understood holistic perspective that encompasses the co-evolution of platform architecture, platform services, and platform governance. to address this research gap, our study examines multiple platform sponsors from an industrial manufacturing context. the study demarcates three platform archetypes: product platform, supply chain platform, and platform ecosystem. we argue that each platform archetype involves a gradual development of platform architecture, platform services, and platform governance, which mirror each other. we also find that each platform archetype is characterized by a specific innovation mechanism that contributes to the platform service discovery and expands the platform value. our study extends the co-evolution perspective of platform ecosystem literature and digital servitization literature.\",\"let\\u2019s stop trying to be \\u201csexy\\u201d \\u2013 preparing managers for the (big) data-driven business era. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to analyze the inadequacies of current business education in the tackling of the educational challenges inherent to the advent of a data-driven business world. it presents an analysis of the implications of digitization and more specifically big data analytics (bda) and data science (ds) on organizations with a special emphasis on decision-making processes and the function of managers. it argues that business schools and other educational institutions have well responded to the need to train future data scientists but have rather disregarded the question of effectively preparing future managers for the new data-driven business era. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the approach involves analysis and review of the literature. findings: the development of analytics skills shall not pertain to data scientists only, it must rather become an organizational cultural component shared among all employees and more specifically among decision makers: managers. in the data-driven business era, managers turn into manager-scientists who shall possess skills at the crossroad of data management, analytical\\u002fmodeling techniques and tools, and business. however, the multidisciplinary nature of big data analytics and data science (bdads) seems to collide with the dominant \\u201cfunctional silo design\\u201d that characterizes business schools. the scope and breadth of the radical digitally enabled change, the author are facing, may necessitate a global questioning about the nature and structure of business education. research limitations\\u002fimplications: for the sake of transparency and clarity, academia and the industry must join forces to standardize the meaning of the terms surrounding big data. bda\\u002fds training programs, courses, and curricula shall be organized in such a way that students shall interact with an array of specialists providing them a broad enough picture of the big data landscape. the multidisciplinary nature of analytics and ds necessitates to revisit pedagogical models by developing experiential learning and implementing a spiral-shaped pedagogical approach. the attention of scholars is needed as there exists an array of unexplored research territories. this investigation will help bridge the gap between education and the industry. practical implications: the findings will help practitioners understand the educational challenges triggered by the advent of the data-driven business era. the implications will also help develop effective trainings and pedagogical strategies that are better suited to prepare future professionals for the new data-driven business world. originality\\u002fvalue: by demonstrating how the advent of a data-driven business era is impacting the function and role of managers, the paper initiates a debate revolving around the question about how business schools and higher education shall evolve to better tackle the educational challenges associated with bdads training. elements of response and recommendations are then provided.\",\"understanding dynamic capabilities. defining ordinary or 'zero-level' capabilities as those that permit a firm to 'make a living' in the short term, one can define dynamic capabilities as those that operate to extend, modify or create ordinary capabilities. logically, one can then proceed to elaborate a hierarchy of higher-order capabilities. however, it is argued here that the strategic substance of capabilities involves patterning of activity, and that costly investments are typically required to create and sustain such patterning - for example, in product development. firms can accomplish change without reliance on dynamic capability, by means here termed 'ad hoc problem solving.' whether higher-order capabilities are created or not depends on the costs and benefits of the investments relative to ad hoc problem solving, and so does the 'level of the game' at which strategies competition effectively occurs.\",\"corporate foresight and dynamic capabilities: an exploratory study. firms engage in forecasting and foresight activities to predict the future or explore possible future states of the business environment in order to pre-empt and shape it (corporate foresight). similarly, the dynamic capabilities approach addresses relevant firm capabilities to adapt to fast change in an environment that threatens a firm\\u2019s competitiveness and survival. however, despite these conceptual similarities, their relationship remains opaque. to close this gap, we conduct qualitative interviews with foresight experts as an exploratory study. our results show that foresight and dynamic capabilities aim at an organizational renewal to meet future challenges. foresight can be regarded as a specific activity that corresponds with the sensing process of dynamic capabilities. the experts disagree about the relationship between foresight and sensing and see no direct links with transformation. however, foresight can better inform post-sensing activities and, therefore, indirectly contribute to the adequate reconfiguration of the resource base, an increased innovativeness, and firm performance.\",\"digital entrepreneurship: an interdisciplinary structured literature review and research agenda. this paper provides a structured literature review of digital entrepreneurship to generate insights into recent developments in the field, critique the research to date, and identify opportunities for future research. we have applied the three aspects of critical research \\u2013 insight, critique, and transformative redefinition \\u2013 to analyse and synthesise the literature. we distil the definitions of the key constructs and identify three research development phases corresponding to practice development. analysis of 133 scholarly articles by discipline, time, methodology, geography and theoretical focus informs that digital entrepreneurship research has been fragmented, divergent and slow to respond to practice. however, the field is now rapidly acquiring legitimacy and an identity, growing rapidly and is becoming more interdisciplinary. we explore how established views of entrepreneurial processes and clusters are being upended in a digital world. in outlining the future of the field, a preponderance of single case study and conceptual articles need to be supplemented with longitudinal, mixed methods, multiple case study and quantitative research. more integrative research, preferably presented as dynamic models, would advance the field. design and action research output, and collaborations with practitioners will yield practice-driven insights. this paper will facilitate an interdisciplinary dialogue for evidence-informed policy and practice.\",\"barriers, practices, methods and knowledge management tools in startups. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to present the main barriers, practices, methods and knowledge management tools in startups that are characterized as agile organizations with dynamic capabilities to meet the demands of a business environment of high volatility, uncertainties, complexity and ambiguity. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the conceptual basis of the research focused on the triad: agile organization, dynamic capabilities and knowledge management. field research began by interviewing experts to identify the barriers, practices, methods and knowledge management tools in startups. based on the theoretical review, on the desk research and on the result of interviews with experts, a quantitative research was carried out with the leading startups coworking of s\\u00e3o paulo city. the obtained data made it possible to develop descriptive analyses and run linear regressions and cluster analysis for exploratory research. findings: startups with higher maturity in innovation level, solution development level, and scalability development level, present a higher degree of utilization of the practices, methods and tools dedicated to knowledge management. practical implications: it is expected that results of the research presented in detail will be able to illustrate concrete examples of practices, methods, and knowledge management tools for large established companies seeking the organizational agility of startups. originality\\u002fvalue: this study contributes to the identification of barriers, practices, methods and tools of management of knowledge in startups, through the conceptual triad: agile organization, dynamic capabilities and knowledge management.\",\"data-driven innovation: switching the perspective on big data. purpose: the pervasive spread of digital technologies brought an incredible boost in data availability. companies are dealing with massive amount of data that wait to be exploited. at the same time, scholars are providing different strategies and methods to help companies capture the value embedded in their data to foster innovation and improve the efficiency of existing processes. in these research studies, data are the by-product of something else, and they are a silent asset that needs to be exploited. what if data might be considered the final goal? the paper aims to discuss these issues. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the research is based on an exploratory multiple case study analysis, on the basis of three cases used as an illustration for new ideas. in particular, the gathered data are analyzed according to models previously presented in the literature review, building on and expanding them. findings: the research proposes a data-driven approach to innovation, offering a peculiar view of the innovation process. the trigger point is the need of data that let begin the entire development process of a complex system. in this perspective, the application that data are a by-product of the entire innovation process and not the primary output is peculiar since the vast majority of the literature consider data as the by-product of the primary product. research limitations\\u002fimplications: future research is needed to assess the replicability of the model outside the mobile app industry and to measure its performances. nevertheless, this paper provides insights both for scholars and managers, enlarging the discussion on digital innovation and digital business models. practical implications: the results provide a development process to foster innovation relying on the need of data as the trigger point, guiding entrepreneurs and managers in the building process of the entire digital system. originality\\u002fvalue: previous research studies often considered big data (bd) in innovation as a way to enlarge the current product offer or to make the innovation process more effective or efficient; this paper changes the perspective by considering bd as the trigger and the enabler of the entire digital innovation process.\",\"big data and dynamic capabilities: a bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review. purpose: recently, several manuscripts about the effects of big data on organizations used dynamic capabilities as their main theoretical approach. however, these manuscripts still lack systematization. consequently, the purpose of this paper is to systematize the literature on big data and dynamic capabilities. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a bibliometric analysis was performed on 170 manuscripts extracted from the clarivate analytics web of science core collection database. the bibliometric analysis was integrated with a literature review. findings: the bibliometric analysis revealed four clusters of papers on big data and dynamic capabilities:

successful digital transformation: complementing technology and market issues. strategic transformation is the primary reason why digitalization, artificial intelligence and related changes are on the top of most corporate agendas. currently, many firms have completed the stage of strategy formulation for their digital transformation and are in the phase of strategy implementation. here, many firms face major difficulties, which often result from an emphasis on technology issues at the expense of market-related issues. following the innovation-based view and a conceptual framework of technology push and market pull effects, this conceptual paper presents important building blocks of successful digital transformation. on this basis, it illustrates the typical focus of most firms at present and highlights the limitations of these approaches. to overcome these limitations, several implementation steps are presented. as such, this paper contributes to research into digital transformation and artificial intelligence as well as into managing strategic renewal in light of technological change.\",\"ambidextrous organization and agility in big data era: the role of business process

design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a theoretical analysis of the potential of bda-capable bpms in increasing organizational agility, with particular attention to the ambidextrous organizations, has been performed. a conceptual framework was subsequently developed. next, the proposed conceptual framework was applied in a real-world context. findings: the research proposes a framework highlighting the importance of bda-capable bpms in increasing ambidextrous organizations\\u2019 agility. moreover, the authors apply the framework to the cases of consumer-goods companies that have included bda in their processes management. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the principal limitations are linked to the need to validate quantitatively the proposed framework. practical implications: the value of the proposed framework is related to its potential in helping managers to fully understand and exploit the potentiality of bda-capable bpms. moreover, the implications show some guidelines to ease the implementation of such systems within ambidextrous organizations. originality\\u002fvalue: the research offers a model to interpret the effects of bda-capable bpms on ambidextrous organizations\\u2019 agility. in this way, the research addresses a significant gap by exploring the importance of information systems for ambidextrous organizations\\u2019

national economies levels. digital economy performance is a matter of national strategies for achieving economic growth and socioeconomic development. widely accepted instruments for reporting progress in these areas have been recently developed, including the digital economy and society index (desi index). the current study aims to use the desi index and its five dimensions (namely connectivity, human capital, use of internet services, integration of digital technology and digital public services) not only as a tool for recognizing the current state, but also to forecast progress under the greek economic environment. the gompertz model was used as a methodological tool and it is valuable that a diffusion model has been implemented on a composite index related to countries\\u2019 digital competitiveness. moreover, the results reveal the areas where convergencies and divergencies exist between greece and the rest of the eu-28 member states, while forecast permits one to evaluate how current policies have a significant impact on digital competitiveness. results indicate that greece is facing significant challenges as a result of the low state of digitization, coming from both the demand side (businesses that consume internet services) and the offer side (institutional and governmental constraints). the proposed results could be used in order to readjust existing policies and to spot aspects where further improvement is needed to achieve high standards of digital competitiveness.\",\"ethical issues in big data analytics: a stakeholder perspective. big data analytics is a fast-evolving phenomenon shaped by interactions among individuals, organizations, and society. however, its ethical implications for these stakeholders remain empirically underexplored and not well understood. we present empirical findings from a delphi study that identified, defined, and examined the key concepts that underlie ethical issues in big data analytics. we then analyze those concepts using stakeholder theory and discourse ethics and suggest ways to balance interactions between individuals, organizations, and society in order to promote the ethical use of big data analytics. our findings inform practitioners and policymakers concerned with ethically using big data analytics and provide a basis for future research.\",\"reviewing the intellectual structure and evolution of the innovation systems approach: a social network analysis. the increased attention of policymakers and researchers to the concept of innovation systems in recent decades has led to an increase in studies in this field and, consequently, its dynamics. this increase in the number of studies indicates the necessity of conducting studies to delineate the intellectual structure and process of development and evolution of this field. the present study aims to present a picture of the structure, evolution, and dynamics of innovation systems through the analysis of academic social networks based on bibliometric criteria and identify emerging issues for research. accordingly, using citation, word co-occurrence, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling analyses, we analyzed 3250 documents which had been published between 1988 and 2018 and extracted from the web of science database. through a systematic review, theoretical roots and frameworks affecting this field were identified and the existing research streams were introduced. according to the analyses, historical and contemporary views were categorized into four clusters. in addition, the most important and emerging issues in this field were identified and the most influential documents, journals, and authors were introduced.\",\"technology forecasting using matrix map and patent clustering. purpose - the purpose of this paper is to propose an objective method for technology forecasting (tf). for the construction of the proposed model, the paper aims to consider new approaches to patent mapping and clustering. in addition, the paper aims to introduce a matrix map and k-medoids clustering based on support vector clustering (km-svc) for vacant tf. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002f approach - tf is an important research and development (ramp;d) policy issue for both companies and government. vacant tf is one of the key technological planning methods for improving the competitive power of firms and governments. in general, a forecasting process is facilitated subjectively based on the researcher's knowledge, resulting in unstable tf performance. in this paper, the authors forecast the vacant technology areas in a given technology field by analyzing patent documents and employing the proposed matrix map and km-svc to forecast vacant technology areas in the management of technology (mot). findings - the paper examines the vacant technology areas for mot patent documents from the usa, europe, and china by comparing these countries in terms of technology trends in mot and identifying the vacant technology areas by country. the matrix map provides broad vacant technology areas, whereas km-svc provides more specific vacant technology areas. thus, the paper identifies the vacant technology areas of a given technology field by using the results for both the matrix map and km-svc. practical implications - the authors use patent documents as objective data to develop a model for vacant tf. the paper attempts to objectively forecast the vacant technology areas in a given technology field. to verify the performance of the matrix map and km-svc, the authors conduct an experiment using patent documents related to mot (the given technology field in this paper). the results suggest that the proposed forecasting model can be applied to diverse technology fields, including ramp;d management, technology marketing, and intellectual property management. originality\\u002fvalue - most tf models are based on qualitative and subjective methods such as delphi. that is, there are few objective models. in this regard, this paper proposes a quantitative and objective tf model that employs patent documents as objective data and a matrix map and km-svc as quantitative methods. copyright\",\"achieving superior organizational performance via big data predictive analytics: a dynamic capability view. the art of unwinding voluminous data expects the expertise in analyzing meaningful decisions out of the acquired information. to encounter new age challenges, practitioners are trying hard to shatter the constraints and work edge-to-edge to achieve higher performance (market, financial and operational performance). it is evident that organizations desire to exploit maximum of their injected resources, but often fail to reap their actual potential. developing resource-based capabilities stands out to be the most concerned aspect for the firms in recent times, and the same is studied by the previous scholars. in the dearth of literature, it is challenging to find out evidence which marks up the effect of strategic resources in the development of dynamic organizational capability. this study is a two-fold attempt to examine the relationship between organizational capabilities, i.e. big data predictive analytics while achieving superior organizational performance; also, examining the effect of control variables on superior organizational of performance. we tested our research hypotheses using cross-sectional data of 209 responses collected using pre-tested single-informant questionnaire. the results underpin criticality human factor while developing analytical capabilities dynamic in nature in the process of achieving superior performance.\",\"using data sciences in digital marketing: framework, methods, and performance metrics. in the last decade, the use of data sciences, which facilitate decision-making and extraction of actionable insights and knowledge from large datasets in the digital marketing environment, has remarkably increased. however, despite these advances, relevant evidence on the measures to improve the management of data sciences in digital marketing remains scarce. to bridge this gap in the literature, the present study aims to review (i) methods of analysis, (ii) uses, and (iii) performance metrics based on data sciences as used in digital marketing techniques and strategies. to this end, a comprehensive literature review of major scientific contributions made so far in this research area is undertaken. the results present a holistic overview of the main applications of data sciences to digital marketing and generate insights related to the creation of innovative data mining and knowledge discovery techniques. important theoretical implications are discussed, and a list of topics is offered for further research in this field. the review concludes with formulating recommendations on the development of digital marketing strategies for businesses, marketers, and non-technical researchers and with an outline of directions of further research on innovative data mining and knowledge discovery applications.\",\"firms' digitalization and stock price crash risk. effects of digital transformation on value creation, productivity, and innovation have been previously examined. however, only a few studies have explored how the capital market responds to firms' digitalization, and the relationship between digital transformation and stock price crash risk has remained unknown. the current study explores this gap by using data of listed firms in china in 2007\\u20132020. we create a chinese dictionary containing digital keywords by using the deep learning model, and set the proportion of intangible assets related to digital keywords as proxy for digital transformation. findings show that digital transformation significantly reduces stock price crash risk. moreover, results remain robust after addressing endogeneity problems and several robustness tests. heterogeneity analysis suggests that the attenuation effect of digital transformation on stock price crash risk is strong for firms that are small, with low analyst attention, in the tech industries, and in areas with high trust. this study validates two potential mechanisms, namely, information and internal control channels. lastly, digital transformation significantly reduces opacity and increases internal control quality.\",\"big data and firm marketing performance: findings from knowledge-based view. a universal trend in advanced manufacturing countries is defining industry 4.0, industrialized internet and future factories as a recent wave, which may transform the production and its related services. further, big data analytics has emerged as a game changer in the business world due to its uses for increasing accuracy in decision-making and enhancing performance of sustainable industry 4.0 applications. this study intends to emphasize on how to support industry 4.0 with knowledge based view. for the same, a conceptual model is framed and presented with essential components that are required for a real world implementation. the study used qualitative analysis and was guided by a knowledge-based theoretical framework. thematic analysis resulted in the identification of a number of emergent categories. key findings highlight significant gaps in conventional decision-making systems and demonstrate how big data enhances firms\\u2019 strategic and operational decisions as well as facilitates informational access for improved marketing performance. the resulting proposed model can provide managers with a reference point for using big data to line up firms\\u2019 activities for more effective marketing efforts and presents a conceptual basis for further empirical studies in this area.\",\"digitalization and business models: where are we going? a science map of the field. scientific research on digitalization and its impact on business models has been growing exponentially in recent years. this has been particularly evident from 2010 onwards, following a landmark special issue published in long range planning. this article offers an overview of the development of academic literature published between 2010 and 2019 with regards to the relationship between digitalization and business models in 198 peer-reviewed articles. by applying a novel methodological approach to compare results from different bibliometric analyses, such as the analysis of citations, co-citations, bibliographic coupling, and co-occurrences of keywords, we have identified the most influential journals, authors, and articles, as well as three thematic clusters (technological innovation, strategic management, and digital transformation). for each cluster, the most relevant contributions are presented. promising research areas and future research directions are identified to address the existing gaps in knowledge.\",\"the role of big data in shaping ambidextrous business process management: case studies from the service industry. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to explore how big data can shape ambidextrous business process management (bpm) in terms of exploitation and exploration. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a qualitative methodology involving case studies has been chosen to explore the impact of big data deployment on exploitative and explorative business processes. findings: the results of case studies offer some opportunities and challenges for service firms related to both the exploitative and the explorative aspects of bpm driven by big data. originality\\u002fvalue: the deployment of big data in business processes has attracted a large amount of interest recently. however, these studies are mostly conceptual, so empirical research about this complex relationship is quite rare, especially research with specific arguments regarding exploitative and explorative activities. this paper aims to fill this gap by offering empirical evidence for big data-driven business processes.\",\"dynamic capabilities for digital transformation. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to identify sensing, seizing and reconfiguring routines of dynamic capabilities that enable digital transformation in firms. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a qualitative approach is used. representatives from a firm going through digital transformations are interviewed, and focus groups have been carried out with a consultancy firm experienced in giving advice to firms going through digital transformation. findings: six routines identified as relevant specifically for digital transformation are identified. these are cross-industrial digital sensing, inside-out digital infrastructure sensing, digital strategy development, determination of enterprise boundaries, decomposition of digital

in relation to previous research, the authors provide more specific guidance regarding how to reconfigure the organization in digital transformation. originality\\u002fvalue: the paper uses a novel context for digital transformation and complements the very few studies available using dynamic capabilities to understand digital transformation.\",\"seeing through the eyes of a rival: competitor acumen based on rival-centric perceptions. this research advances the construct of competitor acumen, or the extent to which a focal firm's assessment of a given rival's prioritization of its competitors reflects the rival's own view. we propose that the way a firm is embedded within marketengagement relationships shapes the firm's competitor acumen. we test our propositions using data collected from the u.s. airline industry and highlight the significance of competitor acumen by showing its impact on a focal firm's market share gain relative to a rival. the findings contribute to competitive dynamics research and suggest a new approach to competitor analysis based on rival-centric perceptions.\",\"big data analytics capability and co-innovation: an empirical study. business; economics; information science; big data analytics capabilities; co-innovation; big data; co-creation\",\"dynamics of open innovation in the food industry. a growing number of chain actors, together with difficulties in single-handedly meeting the heterogeneous needs of customers, end-users and legislators, is driving the food industry to open up to external sources of knowledge in search of successful new products and technologies. empirical evidence of food companies engaging in open innovation remains, however, scarce, as do detailed analyses of related business strategies. we review extant literature on open innovation practices in the food industry and analyze their effects on the sector's innovation capabilities and market outcomes. finally, we draw implications for food innovation and highlight areas where research is needed.\",\"big data and human resources management: the rise of talent analytics. the purpose of this paper is to discuss the opportunities talent analytics offers hr practitioners. as the availability of methodologies for the analysis of large volumes of data has substantially improved over the last ten years, talent analytics has started to be used by organizations to manage their workforce. this paper discusses the benefits and costs associated with the use of talent analytics within an organization as well as to highlight the differences between talent analytics and other sub-fields of business analytics. it will discuss a number of case studies on how talent analytics can improve organizational decision-making. from the case studies, we will identify key channels through which the adoption of talent analytics can improve the performance of the hr function and eventually of the whole organization. while discussing the opportunities that talent analytics offer organizations, this paper highlights the costs (in terms of data governance and ethics) that the widespread use of talent analytics can generate. finally, it highlights the importance of trust in supporting the successful implementation of talent analytics projects.\",\"big data analytics capabilities: a systematic literature review and research agenda. with big data growing rapidly in importance over the past few years, academics and practitioners have been considering the means through which they can incorporate the shifts these technologies bring into their competitive strategies. to date, emphasis has been on the technical aspects of big data, with limited attention paid to the organizational changes they entail and how they should be leveraged strategically. as with any novel technology, it is important to understand the mechanisms and processes through which big data can add business value to companies, and to have a clear picture of the different elements and their interdependencies. to this end, the present paper aims to provide a systematic literature review that can help to explain the mechanisms through which big data analytics (bda) lead to competitive performance gains. the research framework is grounded on past empirical work on it business value research, and builds on the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities view of the firm. by identifying the main areas of focus for bda and explaining the mechanisms through which they should be leveraged, this paper attempts to add to literature on how big data should be examined as a source of competitive advantage. to this end, we identify gaps in the extant literature and propose six future research themes.\",\"big data empowered agility for dynamic, volatile, and time-sensitive service industries: the case of tourism sector. purpose: dynamic, volatile, and time-sensitive industries, such as tourism, travel and hospitality require agility and market intelligence to create value and achieve competitive advantage. the aim of the current study is to examine the influence of big data (bd) on the performance of service organizations and to probe for a deeper understanding of implementing bd, based on available technologies. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: an ethnographic study was conducted following an abductive approach. a primary qualitative research scheme was used with 35 information technology and database professionals participating in five online focus groups of seven participants each. analytical themes were developed simultaneously with the literature being revisited throughout the study to ultimately create sets of common themes and dimensions. findings: bd can help organizations build agility, especially within dynamic industries, to better predict customer behavioral patterns and make tailor-made propositions from the bd. an integrated bd-specific framework is proposed to address value according to the dimensions of need, value, time and utility. research limitations\\u002fimplications: little research exists on the key drivers of bd use for dynamic, real-time and agile businesses. this research adds to the developing literature on bd applications to support organizational decision-making and business performance in the tourism industry. originality\\u002fvalue: this study responds to scholars\\u2019 recent calls for more empirical research with contextual understanding of the use of bd to add value in marketing intelligence within business ecosystems. it delineates factors contributing to bd value creation and explores the impacts on the respective service encounters.\",\"business opportunities and challenges as the two sides of the climate change: corporate responses and potential implications for big data management towards a low carbon society. climate change represents a long-term risk to society, and this risk extends to organizations across several sectors. the risks associated with climate change have both pros and cons, and it is thus important to understand how organizations deal with the opportunities and challenges that climate change presents. furthermore, big data has gained increasing prominence due to its potential to transform ways of doing business. it is therefore important to understand the implications which big data will have for managing corporate responses to the opportunities and challenges presented by climate change. in this context, this article aimed to identify and analyze the challenges and opportunities that the climate crisis presents for organizations and to understand how organizations respond to this scenario, while examining the implications of big data management. this work adopted a structured literature review research method. the review showed that the opportunities emerging from the climate crisis tend to improve performance (environmental, financial and operational) as well as generating new business, while the challenges are related to the lack, or inefficiency, of governmental and regulatory support and an increase in costs. it was also identified that organizations respond to the climate crisis by investing in research and development, as well as through cooperation with other organizations. the results of this research serve as a guide for organizations that are concerned with the climate crisis situation, but currently can neither face the challenges it presents nor realize that this apparently threatening scenario also holds great business potential. the article also contributes to the debate on climate change policy by means of shedding light on possible methods to encourage organizations to make short-term investments to deal with the contingencies presented by climate change. finally, the article also highlights the effects of big data.\",\"innovation analytics and digital innovation experimentation: the rise of research-driven online review platforms. big data analytics constitute one of the driving forces of the fourth industrial revolution and represent one of the founding pillars of industry 4.0. they are increasingly leveraged to create business insights from online reviews of products and services by a wide range of organizations and firms. in this work, we develop a typology of online review platforms (orps) and describe a novel platform, research-driven online review platform (rorp), that combines the science and rigor of very large-scale, low-cost, fast-paced, and complex digital experimentation using real-world customers on digital platforms with the power of modern ai-based big data analytics capabilities (bdac) to generate novel innovation insights for the digital age. using multiple real-world case studies, we illustrate how rorps operate and deliver value through innovation analytics, and serve as a powerful tool for digital innovation experimentation, enabling firms to innovate more effectively and transform their business models to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions. we shed light on the bdac requirements, as well as the benefits and challenges of using rorps and innovation analytics, particularly in the post-covid-19 world, and offer strategic and operational implications for entrepreneurs and innovation managers.\",\"data-driven supply chain capabilities and performance: a resource-based view. despite the importance and relevance of data-driven supply chains, there has been very limited empirical research that investigates how big data-driven supply chains affect supply chain capabilities. drawing on the resource-based view, this study explores the effect of data-driven supply chain capabilities on financial performance. the data for this study were gathered from china's manufacturing industry and analysed using structural equation modelling. the results indicate that a data-driven supply chain has a significant positive effect on the four dimensions of supply chain capabilities. coordination and supply chain responsiveness are positively and significantly related to financial performance.\",\"achieving strategic flexibility in the era of big data: the importance of knowledge management and ambidexterity. purpose: this research unpacks the micro-mechanisms that exist between an organisation's ability to conduct big data analytics (bda) and its achievement of strategic flexibility. knowledge management capabilities and organisational ambidexterity have long been considered factors influencing the aforementioned relationship. in order to assess this, the authors build on dynamic capabilities as the main theoretical lens through which to examine. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: structural equation modelling (sem) is the main methodological approach used in this research. a structural model was developed and tested based on 215 survey responses collected from managers of organisations in continental europe. findings: the results indicate that bda capabilities are a significant antecedent of an organisation's strategic flexibility. this relationship, however, is influenced by knowledge management capabilities and ambidexterity. practical implications: managers wishing to properly exploit the potential of big data should invest in the elaboration of knowledge management processes across their organisation. this strategy can foster strategic flexibility. originality\\u002fvalue: previous research has explored the theoretical links between big data, knowledge management and strategic flexibility. however, little attention has been paid to the quantitative investigation of the phenomenon.\",\"value creation in big data scenarios: a literature survey. knowing how value creation is understood and managed by big data-based companies can be a key strategy to boost business. the typical process of identifying value creation in organizations is quite complex, since it involves internal and external factors to them. in big data scenarios, we should also consider the uncertainty about future processes of value creation, regarding the trends inferred by predictive analytics processes. big data environments operate in a scale of large volumes of parallel-processed data; and aim to generate relevant information that otherwise would be impossible for traditional systems, especially if we expect good performance of transaction speed and of coping with the extensive variety of data types, inherent to such environments. in order to properly identify and work with the idea of value in their businesses, big data-based companies have thus far more challenging hurdles to overcome. this paper proposes a survey of the creation of value in such environments. for this purpose, we undertook a theoretical study, which relied in a qualitative method approach of bibliographical, exploratory and descriptive nature. finally, since this work is still on progress and it is not yet a conclusive proposal, we aim to compare our preliminary results to the typical perception of value creation, found in the literature.\",\"big data analytics capabilities and performance: evidence from a moderated multi-mediation model. big data analytics (bda) have the power to revolutionize traditional ways of doing business. nevertheless, the impact of bda capabilities on a firm's performance is still not fully understood. these capabilities relate to the flexibility of the bda infrastructure and the skills of the management and the firm's personnel. most scholars explored the phenomenon from either a theoretical standpoint or neglected intermediate factors, such as organizational traits. this article builds on the dynamic capabilities view to propose and empirically test a model exploring whether organizational ambidexterity and agility mediate the relationship between bda capabilities and organizational performance. using data from surveys of 259 managers of large european organizations, we tested a proposed model using bootstrapped moderated mediation analysis. we found that organizational bda capabilities affect a firm's ambidexterity and agility, which, in turn, affect its performance. these results establish ambidexterity and agility as positive mediators in the relationship between organizational bda capabilities and a firm's performance. furthermore, the organizational resistance to the implementation of information management systems and the fit between the organization and these systems also moderated this relationship. practical implications for managers are also discussed.\",\"exploring how consumer goods companies innovate in the digital age: the role of big data analytics companies. the advent and development of digital technologies have brought about a proliferation of online consumer reviews (ocrs), i.e., real-time customers\\u2019 evaluations of products, services, and brands. increasingly, e-commerce platforms are using them to gain insights from customer feedback. meanwhile, a new generation of big data analytics (bda) companies are crowdsourcing large volumes of ocrs by means of controlled ad hoc online experiments and advanced machine learning (ml) techniques to forecast demand and determine the market potential for new products in several industries. we illustrate how this process is taking place for consumer goods companies by exploring the case of uk digital bda company, soundout. based on an in-depth qualitative analysis, we develop the consumer goods company innovation (cgci) conceptual framework, which illustrates how digital bda firms help consumer goods companies to test new products before they are launched on the market, and innovate. theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.\",\"the duality of digital and environmental orientations in the context of smes: implications for innovation performance. debate surrounding the performance outcomes of a firm's strategic commitment to digitalization and environmental sustainability (namely, digital orientation and environmental orientation, respectively) is gathering pace. despite progress, there remains no conclusive evidence on whether, and how digital orientation and environmental orientations enhance innovation outcomes, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (smes). therefore, this paper examines the direct and complementary effects of digital and environmental orientations on the likelihood that smes introduce product and\\u002for process innovations (i.e., product and process innovation performance). the study tests its hypotheses on a sample of 369 north american smes. results demonstrate that digital and environmental orientation have a positive direct effect on product and process innovation performance. instead, the complementary effect of pursuing a dual strategy towards digitization and environmental sustainability has a negative impact on process innovation performance and is not significant for product innovation performance. these results add new insights to theory linking strategic orientation to innovation performance, with specific regard to smaller firms.\",\"profiting from innovation and the intellectual property revolution. this paper reviews the contribution of teece's article [teece, d., 1986. profiting from technological innovation: implications for integration, collaboration, licensing and public policy. research policy 15, 285-305.]. it then re-examines the core concept of appropriability in the light of recent developments in the business environment. whereas twenty years ago the appropriability regime of an industry was exogenous and given, today they are often the product of conscious strategies of firms. and as open source software and other industries show, advantageous appropriability regimes are not always \\\"tight\\\" or characterized by strong intellectual property protections. the strategies adopted by firms that have successfully profited from their innovative activities cast into new light old questions about the impact of intellectual property protection on the rate and direction of innovation.\",\"dynamic capabilities for ecosystem orchestration a capability-based framework for smart city innovation initiatives. firms are faced with increased dynamism due to rapid technological development, digitalization, and sustainability requirements, creating novel opportunities for ecosystem innovation. this is particularly prevalent in smart city contexts where initiatives concerning, for example, energy efficient buildings and smart energy grids drive new kinds of ecosystem formation. orchestrating emerging innovation ecosystems can offer a path to sustained competitive advantage for ecosystem leaders. yet, it calls for the development of new capabilities to sense, seize, and reconfigure digitalization opportunities in a highly dynamic ecosystem environment. yet, prior research lacks insights into the dynamic capabilities and routines required for ecosystem innovation. therefore, this study investigates how firms can develop dynamic capabilities to orchestrate ecosystem innovation and, thus, gain from it. through a multiple case study of smart city initiatives, we offer insights into the specific micro-foundations or sub-routines underlying the ecosystem leader's sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities, which are necessary to orchestrate ecosystem innovation. we develop a capability-based framework demonstrating three orchestration mechanisms \\u2013 namely, configuring ecosystem partnerships, value proposition deployment, and governing ecosystem alignment. our findings carry implications for the literature on innovation ecosystems and dynamic capabilities, as well as for managers.\",\"creating and capturing value from big data: a multiple-case study analysis of provider companies. big data has recently emerged as a new digital paradigm, one that companies adopt in order to both transform existing business models and nurture their innovation activities. the peculiarities of big data applications span different fields such as customer need identification, risk management and decision-making, data-driven knowledge, product and service design, quality management, and opportunity recognition and creation. however, while these have resulted in the emergence of a rich research domain focusing on the managerial and practical implications typically addressed from the user perspective, there is still a lack of complete understanding of how companies that provide big data solutions can create and capture value from them. this paper explores the question of how provider companies create and capture value from big data, drawing on a multiple-case study analysis of provider companies that offer solutions and services based on big data. the results illustrate a theoretical framework on value creation and capture by relying on big data and identify two main innovation service strategies based on big data used by provider companies. in addition, this paper provides valuable insights as to how the network of involved stakeholders influences the design and implementation of the innovation service strategy by the provider companies.\",\"an empirical investigation on how big data analytics influence china smes performance: do product and process innovation matter?. globalization and a keen interest in big data have directed the firms to develop and utilize big data analytics (bda) to bring technological innovation (ti) and enhance firm productivity. using resource-based view theory (rbvt), we intend to predict ti and smes\\u2019 performance through bda. therefore, we recruited 312 chinese smes\\u2019 officials using survey methods. the proposed model and structural associations were examined in amos. the findings suggest that bda (predictive-and-prescriptive) is positively related to ti (product-and-process) and smes\\u2019 performance. moreover, ti (product-and-process) mediates the relationship between bda and smes performance. finally, the study discussion and implications are recorded.\",\"digital transformation in family-owned mittelstand firms: a dynamic capabilities perspective. digital technologies are increasingly affecting industries worldwide in many ways. although the adoption of digital technologies by firms has been studied extensively from a technical point of view, previous research lacks insight into the managerial aspects of digital transformation, which, given the transformation\\u2019s interdisciplinarity, might have substantial implications for information systems research. in particular, it is unclear how small and medium-sized family-controlled firms (known as family-owned mittelstand firms) with resource constraints handle digital transformation. this paper addresses this gap by drawing on rich data from 127 semi-structured interviews in a multiple case study of 15 family-owned mittelstand firms from germany, austria, and switzerland. all of these firms are active in the manufacturing industry but vary in terms of their digital transformation progress. based on within-case and cross-case pattern analysis, we propose that the digital transformation of mittelstand firms is a process consisting of three stages, namely, process digitalisation, product and service digitalisation, and business model digitalisation, and we reveal triggers for each stage and the dynamic capabilities needed throughout this process. moreover, we identify three combinations of enablers and barriers that support or hinder the development of dynamic capabilities and thus accelerate or impede the advancement of the digital transformation process.\",\"knowledge sharing in international markets for product and process innovation: moderating role of firm's absorptive capacity. purpose: this study examines the relationship between knowledge-sharing activities of the firm and its innovation capability. it also investigates the moderating impact of the firms' absorptive capacity on the relationship between knowledge sharing and firm innovation capability from the cross-subsidiary perspective in the international market environment. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this study reviewed the literature from the areas of knowledge management, international market and innovation management. through the literature review, absorptive capacity theory and dynamic capability view (dcv) theory, a conceptual model has been developed. this model has been validated using partial least squares structural equation modeling (pls-sem) technique with 612 respondents from 16 multinational firms from different countries. findings: the study finds that knowledge-sharing activities across subsidiaries of multinational firms are important for product and process innovation. firms\\u2019 absorptive capacity also impacts the relationship between firms' knowledge-sharing activities and their different dynamic capabilities, such as sensing, seizing and transforming. the study also finds that firms' innovation capability positively impacts their competitiveness. research limitations\\u002fimplications: this study provides valuable inputs to the management of multinational firms to recognize the importance of knowledge-sharing activities across their different subsidiaries in the international marketing knowledge management (mkm) context. originality\\u002fvalue: the study adds to the literature on knowledge management, international market and firms' innovation capability. as the study examines the knowledge-sharing activities across different subsidiaries of multinational firms, especially in the context of process and product innovation, it is considered unique. the study also provides a unique validated model.\",\"a bibliometric analysis of sustainable oil and gas production research using vosviewer. the role of the oil and gas industry in society is irrefutably vital as it is the main driver of the global energy system which significantly contributes to economic and social development. however, with the growing international concerns especially on climate change and environmental degradation, o&g production should enhance its positive impacts and mitigate its negative effects through sustainable development. this paper aimed to systematically plot the scientific research outputs on sustainable oil and gas production by using a quantitative review technique called bibliometric analysis. the data was retrieved from the scopus database and was analyzed using the vosviewer software. out of 3,493, only 232 keywords from the 312 articles met the threshold and were analyzed. the results showed that the topics related to the [natural] gas industry gained considerable attention from researchers from 1994 to 2021, featured in 163 articles with 1718 total link strength. moreover, one of the recently most citable research topics was related to enhanced recovery of heavy crude oil with 130 total citations from 2019 to 2021. overall, this study could be used by researchers to quantitively examine the trends and future direction of this research topic.\",\"literature reviews as independent studies: guidelines for academic practice. review articles or literature reviews are a critical part of scientific research. while numerous guides on literature reviews exist, these are often limited to the philosophy of review procedures, protocols, and nomenclatures, triggering non-parsimonious reporting and confusion due to overlapping similarities. to address the aforementioned limitations, we adopt a pragmatic approach to demystify and shape the academic practice of conducting literature reviews. we concentrate on the types, focuses, considerations, methods, and contributions of literature reviews as independent, standalone studies. as such, our article serves as an overview that scholars can rely upon to navigate the fundamental elements of literature reviews as standalone and independent studies, without getting entangled in the complexities of review procedures, protocols, and nomenclatures.\",\"the evolution of patent mining: applying bibliometrics analysis and keyword network analysis. text mining methods allow researchers to investigate technical documents (tech mining) and specifically explore patents for valuable information (patent mining. to the review literature and analyze the evolution of patent analysis and patent mining methods, bibliometrics analysis and keyword-based network analysis is applied on 143 papers extracted from the 'web of science' database. bibliometrics analysis was applied to determine top players researching in patent mining. applying cluster analysis on the keyword network shows three main stages of patent analysis evolution. also, it is discussed how patent mining is evolutionized in terms of information retrieval, pattern recognition and pattern analysis.\",\"understanding interfirm relationships in business ecosystems with interactive visualization. business ecosystems are characterized by large, complex, and global networks of firms, often from many different market segments, all collaborating, partnering, and competing to create and deliver new products and services. given the rapidly increasing scale, complexity, and rate of change of business ecosystems, as well as economic and competitive pressures, analysts are faced with the formidable task of quickly understanding the fundamental characteristics of these interfirm networks. existing tools, however, are predominantly query-or list-centric with limited interactive, exploratory capabilities. guided by a field study of corporate analysts, we have designed and implemented dotlink360, an interactive visualization system that provides capabilities to gain systemic insight into the compositional, temporal, and connective characteristics of business ecosystems. dotlink360 consists of novel, multiple connected views enabling the analyst to explore, discover, and understand interfirm networks for a focal firm, specific market segments or countries, and the entire business ecosystem. system evaluation by a small group of prototypical users shows supporting evidence of the benefits of our approach. this design study contributes to the relatively unexplored, but promising area of exploratory information visualization in market research and business strategy.\",\"trajectories of sustainability transitions in scale-transcending innovation systems: the case of photovoltaics. this paper proposes that spatial dynamics of new environmental technologies can be better understood when positioned in a multi-scalar theoretical framework based on innovation system approaches. we combine territorial innovation system concepts with a technological innovation systems (tis) perspective. the investigation of photovoltaic (pv) technology in germany indicates that the relevance of different scales and actor constellations shifts in the course of a 'maturing' innovation system. first, the convergence of regional and institutional subsystems forms a temporary window of opportunity for a robust tis formation within a national framing. second, consolidation according to basic patterns of the underlying national innovation system takes place. this is illustrated by the robust performance of german mechanical pv equipment suppliers within a globalized pv value chain. the empirical findings allow for drafting a theoretical framework that offers a generalized view on this shifting spatial context pattern of an emerging environmental technology.\",\"\\u2018i digitize so i exist\\u2019. searching for critical capabilities affecting firms\\u2019 digital innovation. taking into account the increasing importance of digitalization to characterize companies\\u2019 competitive advantages, and the contextual growing research interest in digital transformation, this paper focuses on dynamic capabilities affecting firms\\u2019 digital innovation in terms of creation of new offerings, processes or solutions by using a wide range of digital technologies. by means of quantitative research on a sample of managers of 210 firms in italy, the study performs an ordinary least squares regression to investigate whether and how different knowledge-based capabilities support the process to develop digital innovation, taking into consideration the moderating effect of social media. despite some limitations, essentially due to the geographical focus of the analysis, the paper contributes to better understand the effect of digitalization in the distinguishing context of the italian companies, providing useful insights to rethink firms\\u2019 innovation models.\",\"ten facts on declining business dynamism and lessons from endogenous growth theory. in this paper, we review the literature on declining business dynamism and its implications in the united states and propose a unifying theory to analyze the symptoms and the potential causes of this decline. we first highlight 10 pronounced stylized facts related to declining business dynamism documented in the literature and discuss some of the existing attempts to explain them. we then describe a theoretical framework of endogenous markups, innovation, and competition that can potentially speak to all of these facts jointly. we next explore some theoretical predictions of this framework, which are shaped by two interacting forces: a composition effect that determines the market concentration and an incentive effect that determines how firms respond to a given concentration in the economy. the results highlight that a decline in knowledge diffusion between frontier and laggard firms could be a significant driver of empirical trends observed in the data. this study emphasizes the potential of growth theory for the analysis of factors behind declining business dynamism and the need for further investigation in this direction.

last years; consequently, there is a need for a systematic review of the existing body of knowledge. this article aims to fill this gap by providing an overview and synthesis of the research topic. the specific objectives are (1) to assess the academic impact, and (2) to determine the structure of the topic. to achieve these goals, a bibliometric analysis will be carried out through a selection of articles taken from the wos database from 1900 to 2019. first, the historical evolution of publications will be addressed, the distribution of articles by journal and by individual author, as well as the total number of citations per article. second, this article will develop networks of co-citations of authors and journals and co-word analysis by using vos viewer software. the global results will provide insights into the nature and trends of research on mergers and acquisitions and sustainability.\",\"linking big data analytical intelligence to customer relationship management performance. this study investigates the driving forces of a firm's assimilation of big data analytical intelligence (bdai) and how the assimilation of bdai improve customer relationship management (crm) performance. drawing on the resource-based view, this study argues that a firm's data-driven culture and the competitive pressure it faces in the industry motivate a firm's assimilation of bdai. as a firm resource, bdai enables an organization to develop superior mass-customization capability, which in turn positively influences its crm performance. in addition, this study proposes that a firm's marketing capability can moderate the impact of bdai assimilation on its mass-customization capability. using survey data collected from 147 business-to-business companies, this study finds support for most of the hypotheses. the findings of this study uncover compelling insights about the dynamics involved in the process of using bdai to improve crm performance.\",\"adoption of big data technology for innovation in b2b marketing. purpose of the paper: the paper explores use of big data in innovation and market leadership in b2b relationships. it provides a framework to analyze the impact of big data, supported by four case studies. methodology\\u002fapproach: this is a conceptual paper, supported by case studies, offering the opportunity for concept generalization. the case study organizations are innovating to stay ahead in the market and to expand activity, using big data to exploit marketing opportunities and create new offerings. findings: organizations are recipients of and are collectors of big data, partly created by the increasing volume of business and customer transactions online. the qualitative exploration of the cases shows that big data and its analytics and applications can be taken as indicators of organizations\\u2019 ability to innovate to respond to market opportunities. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the online marketing environment is a dynamic one, where organizations must innovate to survive. a limitation is that the cases in the paper do not deal with those lagging in innovation, for whom survival is an issue. the paper\\u2019s examples are limited to successful organizations where big data, data mining and analytics led to strategic business success. practical implications: b2b organizations that operate in markets where their own products or services have a significant impact on how the products and services of their b2b customers provide value to end (b2c) customers should, in their innovation activity, engage fully with the end b2c market, together with their b2b customers. this has implications in every area from strategy to human resources. if the b2b organization\\u2019s pedigree includes b2c activity parallel to that of their customers but not competitive, this can give them an advantage in marketing, but if their b2c activities start to encroach on the b2c activities of their customers, this may cause conflict and loss of business. this implies that if marketing strategy becomes siloed between the different branches of the business, the potential for conflict increases. originality\\u002fvalue of the paper: the paper\\u2019s value is in contributing to understanding big data\\u2019s role in business innovation, specifically in business to business organizations and where their innovation can transform customer experience at the end of the value chain, i.e., with final consumers. therefore, the paper helps to address a research gap in the literature, which tends to focus on how such innovation affects business-to-business relationships.\",\"guidelines for advancing theory and practice through bibliometric research. bibliometric research presents unique opportunities to contribute to theory and practice. top journals and scholars from various disciplines have published numerous highly impactful articles utilizing bibliometric techniques to study different fields\\u2019 evolutionary nuances and capture emerging trends. however, studies using bibliometric techniques have often attracted criticism for failing to adequately link their derived analytical and visual outputs with theory building and practice improvement. consequently, we ask the following question: how can bibliometric research contribute to theory and practice? to this end, this editorial (i) premiers the characteristics and distinct contributions of bibliometric research and (ii) proposes a multifaceted approach that (a) researchers can utilize to develop and demonstrate the potential contributions of their bibliometric research and (b) referees (e.g., editors and reviewers) can rely on to effectively decipher and evaluate the framing, positioning, and contributions of bibliometric research. in doing so, we hope to enhance the understanding and contributions of bibliometric research in advancing theory and practice.\",\"big data, big decisions: the impact of big data on board level decision-making. big data (bd) has the potential to \\u2018disrupt\\u2019 the senior management of organisations, prompting directors to make decisions more rapidly and to shape their capabilities to address environmental changes. this paper explores whether, how and to what extent bd has disrupted the process of board level decision-making. drawing upon both the knowledge-based view, and cognitive and dynamic capabilities, we undertook in-depth interviews with directors involved in high-level strategic decision-making. our data reveal important findings in three areas. first, we find evidence of a shortfall in cognitive capabilities in relation to bd, and issues with cognitive biases and cognitive overload. second, we reveal the challenges to board cohesion presented by bd. finally, we show how bd impacts on responsibility\\u002fcontrol within senior teams. this study points to areas for development at three levels of our analysis: individual directors, the board, and a broader view of the organisation with its external stakeholders.\",\"comparative analysis of web of science and scopus on the energy efficiency and climate impact of buildings. although the body of scientific publications on energy efficiency and climate mitigation from buildings has been growing quickly in recent years, very few previous bibliometric analysis studies exist that analyze the literature in terms of specific content (trends or options for zero-energy buildings) or coverage of different scientific databases. we evaluate the scientific literature published since january 2013 concerning alternative methods for improving the energy efficiency and mitigating climate impacts from buildings. we quantify and describe the literature through a bibliometric approach, comparing the databases web of science (wos) and scopus. a total of 19,416 (scopus) and 17,468 (wos) publications are analyzed, with only 11% common documents. the literature has grown steadily during this time period, with a peak in the year 2017. most of the publications are in english, in the area of engineering and energy fuels, and from institutions from china and the usa. strong links are observed between the most published authors and institutions worldwide. an analysis of keywords reveals that most of research focuses on technologies for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning, phase change materials, as well as information and communication technologies. a significantly smaller segment of the literature takes a broader perspective (greenhouse gas emissions, life cycle, and sustainable development), investigating implementation issues (policies and costs) or renewable energy (solar). knowledge gaps are detected in the areas of behavioral changes, the circular economy, and some renewable energy sources (geothermal, biomass, small wind). we conclude that i) the contents of wos and scopus are radically different in the studied fields; ii) research seems to focus on technological aspects; and iii) there are weak links between research on energy and on climate mitigation and sustainability, the latter themes being misrepresented in the literature. these conclusions should be validated with further analyses of the documents identified in this study. we recommend that future research focuses on filling the above identified gaps, assessing the contents of several scientific databases, and extending energy analyses to their effects in terms of mitigation potentials.\",\"exploring the impact of big data analytics capabilities on business model innovation: the mediating role of entrepreneurial orientation. big data analytics capabilities (bdac) represent critical tools for business competitiveness in highly dynamic markets. in this connection, by leveraging on the dynamic capabilities view (dcv) this study analyses the relationship between bdac and business model innovation (bmi). it argues that the impact of bdac (a lower-order dynamic capability) on bmi is mediated by entrepreneurial orientation (eo; a higher-order dynamic capability). the proposed model is assessed by pls-sem (symmetric) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (asymmetric) methods using survey data from 253 uk firms. our findings demonstrate that bdac have both direct and indirect positive effects on bmi, with the latter being mediated by eo. these results enrich the innovation management literature on big data (bd) by showing that bdac influence company strategic logics and objectives, rather than depending on them, thus playing a significant role in creating value for companies and their stakeholders.\",\"entrepreneurial challenges of covid-19: re-thinking entrepreneurship after the crisis. the covid-19 pandemic substantially influenced the world economy, affecting entrepreneurs and smes alike. this paper critically examines the relationship between entrepreneurship and covid-19 through an integrative review analyzing 79 existing studies on the topic. we posit a novel framework for postcrisis recovery, identifying three phases of activity: business resumption (the decision to restart operations following a crisis), crisis impact analysis (understanding how the firm has changed as a result of the crisis), and future review and modification (examining how businesses need to move forward in the latter days following a crisis). further, we call for additional entrepreneurship research embedded in a crisis environment, with the hope that new scholarship in this regard will provide a chance to increase awareness of the critical role of entrepreneurial management in society.\",\"how to combine term clumping and technology roadmapping for newly emerging science & technology competitive intelligence: \\u201cproblem & solution\\u201d pattern based semantic triz tool and case study. competitive technical intelligence addresses the landscape of both opportunities and competition for emerging technologies, as the boom of newly emerging science & technology (nest)\\u2014characterized by a challenging combination of great uncertainty and great potential\\u2014has become a significant feature of the globalized world. we have been focusing on the construction of a \\u201cnest competitive intelligence\\u201d methodology that blends bibliometric and text mining methods to explore key technological system components, current r&d emphases, and key players for a particular nest. this paper emphasizes the semantic triz approach as a useful tool to process \\u201cterm clumping\\u201d results to retrieve \\u201cproblem & solution (p&s)\\u201d patterns, and apply them to technology roadmapping. we attempt to extend our approach into nest competitive intelligence studies by using both inductive and purposive bibliometric approaches. finally, an empirical study for dye-sensitized solar cells is used to demonstrate these analyses.\",\"predicting customer quality in e-commerce social networks: a machine learning approach. the digital transformation of companies is having a major impact on all business areas, especially marketing, where audiences are most volatile and loyalty is at its scarcest. many large retail brands try to keep their client base interested by becoming partners in cashback websites. these websites are based on a specific type of affiliate marketing whereby customers access a wide range of merchants and obtain financial rewards based on their activities. besides using this mix of traditional marketing strategies, cashback websites attract new target customers and increase existing customers\\u2019 loyalty through recommendations, using a word-of-mouth marketing strategy built on economic incentives for users who refer others to these sites. the literature shows that this strategy is one of the major areas of success of this business model because customers who join following recommendation are more active and are therefore more profitable and loyal to the brand. nevertheless, the new users who are referred to these sites vary considerably in terms of the number of transactions they make on the site. this study advances research on the design of recommendation-based digital marketing strategies by providing companies with a predictive model. this model uses data science, including machine learning methods and big data, to personalize financial incentives for users based on the quality of the new customers they refer to the cashback website. companies can thus optimize and maximize the return on their marketing investment.\",\"digital transformation of industrial businesses: a dynamic capability approach. industrial firms are under severe pressure to undertake digital transformation and leverage the industrial internet of things (iiot) and emerging technologies for the integration of industrial machines to share information on a real-time or near real-time basis. though in recent years researchers have focused their attention on digital transformation, there is limited scholarly guidance for developing capabilities for such transformation. drawing on dynamic capability theory and exploratory qualitative interviews with senior \\u2018elite\\u2019 executives from five of the world's largest multinational firms, the study outlines a new conceptual framework for digital transformative capability development. the integrative framework demonstrates how the three core capabilities of digital sensing, digital seizing, and digital reconfiguring manifest through associated capabilities of strategic sensing, rapid prototyping, organization structure, business model transformation, and cultural\\u002fmindset transformation. internal and external contingencies are proposed as moderators of the relationship between iiot and emerging technologies, and digital transformative capability development. collectively, the article makes the case for digital transformation capability and sheds new light on the digital transformation process. implications for theory and practice are highlighted, and limitations are discussed.\",\"ipma delta and ipma organisational competence baseline (ocb): new approaches in the field of project management maturity. purpose \\u2013 the purpose of this paper is to describe the concepts of two new approaches offered by ipma through its internationally widespread member associations: ipma delta\\u00ae for assessing and developing project management maturity and the ipma organisational competence baseline (ocb), acting as reference model for ipma delta. in addition to this description, a case study reveals insights in the usage of ipma delta and the benefits realized through such a holistic assessment of project management maturity. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach \\u2013 the paper takes the form of a conceptual paper and a case study. findings \\u2013 ipma delta is a holistic assessment of the organisational competence in managing projects. three modules are used to assess the competence of selected individuals, the application of project management in selected projects and the organisation's approach of managing projects. through the assessment, an organisation gets insights in regard to the current maturity and the delta to a desired target state. recommendations drive the continuous development of organisational competences in managing projects, which is shown in the case of the chernobyl nuclear power plant. this case study also reveals insights in the benefits realized through such a holistic maturity assessment. originality\\u002fvalue \\u2013 this conceptual paper builds on organisational competence in managing projects, a new concept in the world of maturity models offering a holistic view beyond processes.\",\"big data analytics capabilities and innovation: the mediating role of dynamic capabilities and moderating effect of the environment. with big data analytics growing rapidly in popularity, academics and practitioners have been considering the means through which they can incorporate the shifts these technologies bring into their competitive strategies. drawing on the resource-based view, the dynamic capabilities view, and on recent literature on big data analytics, this study examines the indirect relationship between a big data analytics capability (bdac) and two types of innovation capabilities: incremental and radical. the study extends existing research by proposing that bdacs enable firms to generate insight that can help strengthen their dynamic capabilities, which in turn positively impact incremental and radical innovation capabilities. to test their proposed research model, the authors used survey data from 175 chief information officers and it managers working in greek firms. by means of partial least squares structural equation modelling, the results confirm the authors\\u2019 assumptions regarding the indirect effect that bdacs have on innovation capabilities. specifically, they find that dynamic capabilities fully mediate the effect on both incremental and radical innovation capabilities. in addition, under conditions of high environmental heterogeneity, the impact of bdacs on dynamic capabilities and, in sequence, incremental innovation capability is enhanced, while under conditions of high environmental dynamism the effect of dynamic capabilities on incremental innovation capabilities is amplified.\",\"a theory of digital technology advancement to address the grand challenges of sustainable development. scholarly research has not yet discussed the totality of the 17 sustainable development goals (sdgs) as part of a broader picture of sustainable development. this paper provides a unique analysis of the linkages between institutions, sdgs and digital technologies to establish their exact interdependencies. factor analysis of the grand challenges of sustainable development has shown only sdg3 and sdg17 might progress through institutions\\u2019 development in developed countries, while only sdg16 in developing countries. in developed countries, the institutions of human development, globalisation and innovations influence sdg3, and sdg17, which depend on digitised knowledge and the application of digital technologies. human development and economic freedom, which rely on digital infrastructure and technologies, impacted sdg16 in developing countries. the digital knowledge index and the digital technologies index in developed countries enhance management efficiency, having a maximum impact on sdg3 and sdg17. the findings of this paper contribute to social and economic policy implications on digital technology development for addressing grand challenges.\",\"how do digitalization capabilities enable open innovation in manufacturing enterprises? a multiple case study based on resource integration perspective. enabling open innovation through digitalization capabilities is an important way for manufacturing enterprises to gain a competitive advantage in the digital economy. however, existing research on digital transformation and innovation development in manufacturing enterprises is based on conceptual and review studies, leading to a lack of exploring the mechanisms of digitalization capabilities enabling open innovation. in this research, we conducted a multiple case analysis with interviews and document data from four different types of manufacturing companies with open innovation enabled by digitalization capabilities, providing two key contributions to extant literature. first, resource integration is the bridge that connects digitalization capabilities with open innovation. enterprises further empower open innovation by promoting the identification and acquisition of digital resources, resource matching and utilization through digitalization capabilities. second, the process of digitalization capabilities enabling open innovation is closely linked to internal and external situational factors, with the environmental dynamics and the digital awareness of managers playing a catalytic role. the findings clarify the inner mechanism of digitalization capabilities to drive open innovation from the perspective of resource integration and provide theoretical reference for digital transformation and open innovation practice of manufacturing enterprises.\",\"is knowledge spillover from human capital investment a catalyst for technological innovation? the curious case of fourth industrial revolution in brics economies. the issue of knowledge spillovers, and technological innovation has received immense importance, particularly in the fourth industrial revolution. in this context, this endeavor to carry out this study aims to empirically examine the determinants of technological innovation of brazil, russia, india, china, and south africa (brics) countries, using the data that spans from the year 1990 to 2017. moreover, this study further aims to investigate the role of human capital in mediating the relationship between the spillovers, through imports, foreign direct investment, and the technological progress that will prevail. this study is confined to the employment of the westerlund (2007) cointegration and augmented mean group (amg) method for the analysis. the cointegration method outcomes show that there is a stable, long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables in all the five models that have been considered. the results of the amg method show that in the long run, an increase in the gross domestic product, human capital, research and development expenditures, and the foreign direct investment spillovers, increases the technological innovation in brics economies. the results also suggest that an improvement in the human capital strengthens the relationship between technological innovation and the spillovers. hence, the knowledge spillovers and the developed human capital are more likely to affect the total technological innovation.\",\"using patent information for designing new product and technology: keyword based technology roadmapping. with the rapid change in markets and technologies, it is becoming essential for firms to develop new products constantly. this can most successfully be achieved by using technology roadmaps (trms), which are effective tools for connecting product and technology planning. however, trms generally tend to overstate the qualitative and expert-dependent knowledge rather than incorporating quantitative and objective information. this paper proposes a new approach where patent data are used in a quantitative methodology to support reliable decision-making in roadmapping processes. in this study, text-mining techniques were utilized to extract the relevant information on which portfolio, co-word, and network analyses were carried out. the results were three types of product-technology maps that can be applied to specific roadmapping steps. the suggested approach is expected to yield useful information about roadmapping, and help improve the overall effectiveness and quality of the technique.\",\"beyond best practice. the importance of implementing best management practices is widely understood. however, the authors argue, best practice alone is not enough. they use examples of three high-performing companies to show that those companies not only use standard best practices but also embrace internally developed idiosyncratic \\\"signature processes\\\" that reflect the history and values of the organization and executive team. such \\\"signature processes\\\" - a daily morning meeting of senior executives at the royal bank of scotland group, an easily reconfigured organizational structure at nokia that involves modular teams and a \\\"peer assist\\\" program where business-unit heads help one another at bp plc - help drive high performance because they engender passion and energy within an organization. the mechanisms by which signature processes develop differ from those associated with best-practice ideas, however. the latter are often adapted from shared knowledge originating outside the company, whereas signature processes start with the values that internal executives champion.\",\"strategies for managing knowledge assets: the role of firm structure and industrial context. in the new economy, the sustainable competitive advantage of business firms flows from the creation, ownership, protection and use of difficult-to-imitate commercial and industrial knowledge assets. such assets include tacit and codified know-how, both technical and organisational, whether or not protected by the instruments of intellectual property such as trade secrets, copyrights and patents. competitive advantage undergirded by such assets can be sustainable to the extent to which it is transferable and useable inside the firm, but difficult for outsiders to access and\\u002f or recreate. knowledge management can be used to describe the panoply of procedures and techniques used to get the most from a firm's knowledge assets. information technology can assist knowledge management, but knowledge management involves much more than the astute use of it tools. in particular, knowledge management requires the development of dynamic capabilities... the ability to sense and then seize opportunities quickly and proficiently. this is especially so in environments characterised by increasing returns, irrespective of the appropriability regime. companies slow to respond to the new reality will be severely handicapped.\",\"peculiarities of sustainable development of enterprises in the context of digital transformation. the key elements that contribute to the digital transformation of the enterprise in the context of the cross-industrial paradigm are outlined. on the basis of the proposed elements (development factor, rate of development, quality change density, multiplication factor), and by means of mathematical modelling, the effect of capturing the digital transformation of the enterprise in the bifurcation points is calculated. the totality of the presented developments allows us to predict the development and minimization of risks associated with digital transformation in the enterprise with all the ensuing consequences (stability, dynamics, transformation and forecast of its development vectors) and conclude that with the improvement of the quality of digital transformation, the efficiency of functioning of any production increases, i.e. an increase in quality by digital transformation by n times accompanies an increase in production efficiency by at least n times.this allows to minimize risks and predict enterprise activity taking into account the vector of its development \\u2014 digital transformation. under conditions of uncertainty, the use of the model will ensure the quality of the digital transformation of the enterprise from any level of development of companies.\",\"integrative capability and technology adoption: evidence from oil firms. for most companies, adopting new technology is a necessity of survival. but why do some firms fare better than others in adopting new technology? why do some firms possess a greater ability to integrate it into their operations than others? these questions are addressed via a comparative case study of oil firms that all adopted the same technology: horizontal drilling. two efficacious and two less efficacious adopters were contrasted. they differed in the processes of adoption: the efficacious adopters developed strong strategic commitment to the technology early, facilitating their more extensive external and internal integration activities. the more efficacious firms differed from the less efficacious ones also in their knowledge systems: employee skills, technical and managerial systems, and values and norms. the firms' integrative capability developed through a dynamic interplay of adoption processes and their knowledge systems, and affected efficacy of adoption. we contribute to the literature on firm capabilities by providing an empirically based model of the development of integrative capability in the context of high-uncertainty technology adoption.\",\"building an organizational digital twin. the increasing digitization of the economy means that a new digital resource\\u2014a digital twin of an organization\\u2014is now feasible. we suggest five principles that assist in the construction of an organizational digital twin and show how they combine into a dynamic evolutionary process that builds and maintains the digital twin incrementally. we also discuss the organizational implications of implementing a digital twin and how digital twins create value in an organization.\",\"unlocking the drivers of big data analytics value in firms. although big data analytics (bda) is considered the next \\u201cfrontier\\u201d in data science by creating potential business opportunities, the way to extract those opportunities is unclear. this paper aims to understand the antecedents of bda value at a firm level. the authors performed a study using a mixed methodology approach. first, by carrying out a delphi study to explore and rank the antecedents affecting the creation of bda value. based on the delphi results, we propose an empirically validated model supported by a survey conducted on 175 european firms to explain the antecedents of bda sustained value. the results show that the proposed model explains 62% of bda sustained value at the firm level, where the most critical contributor is bda use. we provide directions for managers to support their decisions on bda strategy definition and refinement. for academics, we extend bda value literature and outline some potential research opportunities.\",\"future scenarios of the collaborative economy: centrally orchestrated, social bubbles or decentralized autonomous?. purpose: the collaborative economy (ce), and within it, collaborative consumption (cc) has become a central element of the global economy and has substantially disrupted service markets (e.g. accommodation and individual transportation). the purpose of this paper is to explore the trends and develop future scenarios for market structures in the ce. this allows service providers and public policy makers to better prepare for potential future disruption. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: thought experiments \\u2013 theoretically grounded in population ecology (pe) \\u2013 are used to extrapolate future scenarios beyond the boundaries of existing observations. findings: the patterns suggested by pe forecast developmental trajectories of ce leading to one of the following three future scenarios of market structures: the centrally orchestrated ce, the social bubbles ce, and the decentralized autonomous ce. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the purpose of this research was to create ce future scenarios in 2050 to stretch one\\u2019s consideration of possible futures. what unfolds in the next decade and beyond could be similar, a variation of or entirely different than those described. social implications: public policy makers need to consider how regulations \\u2013 often designed for a time when existing technologies were inconceivable \\u2013 can remain relevant for the developing ce. this research reveals challenges including distribution of power, insularity, and social compensation mechanisms that need consideration across states and national borders. originality\\u002fvalue: this research tests the robustness of assumptions used today for significant, plausible market changes in the future. it provides considerable value in exploring challenges for public policy given the broad societal, economic, and political implications of the present market predictions.\",\"digital transformation: a review, synthesis and opportunities for future research. in the last years, scholarly attention was on a steady rise leading to a significant increase in the number of papers addressing different technological and organizational aspects of digital transformation. in this paper, we consolidate existing findings which mainly stem from the literature of information systems, map the territory by sharing important macro- and micro-level observations, and propose future research opportunities for this pervasive field. the paper systematically reviews 58 peer-reviewed studies published between 2001 and 2019, dealing with different aspects of digital transformation. emerging from our review, we develop inductive thematic maps which identify technology and actor as the two aggregate dimensions of digital transformation. for each dimension, we derive further units of analysis (nine core themes in total) which help to disentangle the particularities of digital transformation processes and thereby emphasize the most influential and unique antecedents and consequences. in a second step, in order to assist in breaking down disciplinary silos and strengthen the management perspective, we supplement the resulting state-of-the-art of digital transformation by integrating cross-disciplinary contributions from reviewing 28 papers on technological disruption and 32 papers on corporate entrepreneurship. the review reveals that certain aspects, such as the pace of transformation, the culture and work environment, or the middle management perspective are significantly underdeveloped.\",\"understanding the determinants of business intelligence system

four trajectories \\u2013 digital technology, digital strategy, customer experience and data-driven business models \\u2013 that could shape the next generation of services. this includes a discussion on whether both the market and organizations are all ready for the digital change and what are the opportunities that will enable firms to create and capture value though new business models. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: providing services is a proven and effective way to secure a competitive position, deliver long-term stable revenues and open up new market opportunities. however, it is also clear that some organisations are struggling to digitally transform. therefore, the commentary provides a brief insight into how firms explore the possibilities of digital transformation and navigate these uncharted waters. findings: today\\u2019s digital technologies affect the organisation outside and in, enabling the creation of new business models and transforming the customer experience. the incumbents are acutely aware that they need to transform strategically \\u2013 to build new networks and value chains. originality\\u002fvalue: this commentary extends earlier work exploring the digital disruption within services to highlight a number of connected areas: the challenges and opportunities of digital transformation at a strategic level, as well as understanding and enhancing the customer experience and seeing how new data-driven business models can underpin service transformation.\",\"visualizing the structure and bridges of the intellectual property management and strategy literature: a document co-citation analysis. this article uses document co-citation analysis to objectively explore the underlying structure of the intellectual property research domain, taken from a managerial and strategic standpoint. the goal of this study is identifying its main research areas, understanding its current state of development and suggesting potential future directions, by analyzing the co-citations from 181 papers published between 1992 and 2011 in the most influential academic journals. five main clusters have been identified, mapped, and labeled as follows: economics of patent system, technological and institutional capabilities, university patenting, intellectual property exploitation, and division of labor. their most active areas on this topic, and the most influential and co-cited papers have been identified and described. also, intra- and inter-cluster knowledge base diversity has been assessed by using indicators stemming from the domains of information theory and biology. a t test has been performed to assess the significance of the inter-cluster diversity. the knowledge bases of these five clusters are significantly diverse, this meaning that they are five co-existing paradigms.\",\"the competitive effects of the gdpr. the gdpr is the magna carta of data protection, the importance of which cannot be overstated. yet, as this article shows, the price of data protection through the gdpr is much higher than previously recognized. the gdpr creates two main harmful effects on competition and innovation: it limits competition in data markets, creating more concentrated market structures and entrenching the market power of those who are already strong; and it limits data sharing between different data collectors, thereby preventing the realization of some data synergies which may lead to better data-based knowledge. to illustrate its claims, the article analyzes the competitive dynamics created by the gdpr, focusing on how it affects the options available to firms for amassing the data necessary for their operations, and their resultant ability to realize economies of scale and scope in data analysis. it identifies seven main parallel and cumulative market dynamics that may limit data collection and data sharing, only some of which have been recognized so far. as shown, under some market conditions, the gdpr has unintended and so far unrecognized effects on competition, efficiency, innovation, and the resultant welfare. the dynamics identified in this article offer partial explanations for some of the troubling empirical evidence regarding investment in eu data-driven markets following the adoption of the gdpr. furthermore, the analysis enables us to identify which effects are short-term and which are here to stay. the effects on competition and innovation identified may justify a reevaluation of the balance reached to ensure that overall welfare is increased. the article suggests some means of reducing harmful competitive effects, while still protecting the vital goal of privacy, including reaching a better balance between data protection and competition law, reducing uncertainty in the gdpr, creating certification mechanisms for gdpr compliance, and structuring of mandatory data-sharing obligations under other laws in a way, which is sensitive to the dynamics of data markets.\",\"externalities of openness in innovation. discussion of open innovation has typically stressed the benefits to the individual enterprise from boundary-spanning linkages and improved internal knowledge sharing. in this paper we explore the potential for wider benefits from openness in innovation and argue that openness may itself generate positive externalities by enabling improved knowledge diffusion. the potential for these (positive) externalities suggests a divergence between the private and social returns to openness and the potential for a sub-optimal level of openness where this is determined purely by firms' private returns. our analysis is based on irish plant-level panel data from manufacturing industry over the period 1994-2008. based on instrumental variables regression models our results suggest that externalities of openness in innovation are significant and that they are positively associated with firms' innovation performance. we find that these externality effects are unlikely to work through their effect on the spread of open innovation practices. instead, they appear to positively influence innovation outputs by either increasing knowledge diffusion or strengthening competition. our evidence on the significance of externalities from openness in innovation provides a rationale for public policy aimed at promoting open innovation practices among firms.\",\"combining the technological innovation systems framework with the entrepreneurs\\u2019 perspective on innovation. for their technological sustainability innovations to become successful, entrepreneurs can strategically shape the technological field in which they are involved. the technological innovation systems (tiss) literature has generated valuable insights into the processes which need to be stimulated for the successful development and implementation of innovative sustainability technologies. to explore the applicability of the tis framework from the perspective of entrepreneurs, we conducted a case study in the dutch smart grids sector. we found that the tis framework generally matches the perspectives of entrepreneurs. for its use by entrepreneurs, we suggest a slight adaptation of this framework. the process \\u2018market formation\\u2019 needs to be divided into processes that are driven by the government and processes that are driven by entrepreneurs. there should be a greater emphasis on collaborative marketing, on changing user behaviour and preferences and on the development of fair and feasible business models.\",\"technology opportunity discovery to r&d planning: key technological performance analysis. there is a gap between technological opportunities and r&d planning because opportunity information is too broadly defined. thus, we suggest a method of transforming such technological opportunities into a customized and detailed r&d plan. we identify key information for r&d planning, extract such information from bibliometric data by chunk-based mining, and convert it to a usable form for r&d planning. a systematic analysis of normalized performance gaps, performance structure, r&d feasibility and technological alternatives identified important and feasible target technological performance metrics as well as r&d solutions. our method can increase the practical value of technological opportunities while reducing the efforts required of experts.\",\"the impact of big data analytics on firms\\u2019 high value business performance. big data analytics (bda) is an emerging phenomenon with the reported potential to transform how firms manage and enhance high value businesses performance. the purpose of our study is to investigate the impact of bda on operations management in the manufacturing sector, which is an acknowledged infrequently researched context. using an interpretive qualitative approach, this empirical study leverages a comparative case study of three manufacturing companies with varying levels of bda usage (experimental, moderate and heavy). the information technology (it) business value literature and a resource based view informed the development of our research propositions and the conceptual framework that illuminated the relationships between bda capability and organizational readiness and design. our findings indicate that bda capability (in terms of data sourcing, access, integration, and delivery, analytical capabilities, and people\\u2019s expertise) along with organizational readiness and design factors (such as bda strategy, top management support, financial resources, and employee engagement) facilitated better utilization of bda in manufacturing decision making, and thus enhanced high value business performance. our results also highlight important managerial implications related to the impact of bda on empowerment of employees, and how bda can be integrated into organizations to augment rather than replace management capabilities. our research will be of benefit to academics and practitioners in further aiding our understanding of bda utilization in transforming operations and production management. it adds to the body of limited empirically based knowledge by highlighting the real business value resulting from applying bda in manufacturing firms and thus encouraging beneficial economic societal changes.\",\"internationalization, digitalization, and sustainability: are smes ready? a survey on synergies and substituting effects among growth paths. internationalization, digitalization, and sustainability are three key growth paths for firms. in particular, the contemporary economy stresses the relevance of digital transformation as a central driver towards innovation and business renewal, especially for established small and medium sized enterprises (smes). however, little is known about the relationships among the above-mentioned growth paths, whether they are competing or complementary options. our contribution addresses this gap focusing on two forms of organizational readiness within smes. first, it investigates the impact of artificial intelligence readiness on international performance. second, it explores whether the relationship between digitalization and internationalization is affected by sustainability readiness. the empirical survey relies on a sample consisting of 438 smes, including both domestic and international companies. findings confirm, as expected, that artificial intelligence readiness positively influences the international performance of smes. moreover, we find that digitalization and sustainability are positively related, but they turn to be competing growth paths when the firm internationalizes.\",\"innovation networks and capability building in the australian high-technology smes. purpose - studies of capability building and organisational learning through networked arrangements have been growing in recent years. in high-technology industries, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises overcome problems of resource and information limitations by becoming a part of a knowledge network. this paper seeks to examine innovation networks of the australian high-technology small and medium enterprises (smes) by focusing on the linkages employed by small businesses to learn, adapt to technological change, and innovate. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach - to study the innovation networks of high-technology firms, research was conducted on biotechnology firms within the sydney region and information and communication technology (ict) firms within the metropolitan area of melbourne. a mixed methodology approach for this research was adopted and a combination of quantitative and qualitative data was collected, via the means of a questionnaire and face-to-face interviews. findings - the paper reports a range of findings on the nature and type of networked relationships and offers analysis of the extent of innovation linkages within the biotech clusters in sydney and ict cluster within melbourne. research limitations\\u002fimplications - limitation of the sample size indicates limited generalisability of final results and findings should be treated with caution. practical implications - this research highlights critical factors of innovation success in the context of network linkages. this network analysis may enable more effective decision making on improving innovation processes on competitive capabilities by regional policy makers and firm managers. originality\\u002fvalue - the paper reports the analysis and extent of innovation linkages within the biotech cluster in sydney and ict cluster the in melbourne metropolitan area.\",\"family influence and digital business model innovation: the enabling role of dynamic capabilities. new digital technologies have prompted many firms, including family firms, to innovate their business models. we study the role of dynamic capabilities as mediator in the relationship between family influence and digital business model innovation (bmi), and the moderating role of environmental dynamism. based on unique survey data from 1,444 german firms with and without family influence, we reveal that knowledge exploitation, risk management, and marketing capabilities mediate the positive relationship between family influence and digital bmi. surprisingly, and contrary to our assumption, we find that the positive relationship between family influence and dynamic capabilities is weakened rather than strengthened by environmental dynamism. our findings hold important implications for family business innovation and digital bmi research, offering valuable insights into the role of dynamic capabilities and environmental dynamism in the digital economy.\",\"is digitalization a driver to enhance environmental performance? an empirical investigation of european countries. this article is the first to analyze empirically the impact of digitalization on environmental performance, using a database of 25 european countries over the period 2015\\u20132020. we use two dimensions, human health protection and ecosystem protection, to reflect environmental performance, which are collected from the yale center for environmental law and policy. digitalization is captured by digital connectivity, human capital with digital skills, use of the internet, integration of digital technology in business, and digital public services, which are sourced from eurostat - community survey and egovernment benchmarking report. our results demonstrate that the digital transformation process, especially digital skills, business digitization, and digital public services, enhances environmental performance. we emphasize the importance of business digitization and digital public services on environmental health, and digital connectivity, digital skills, and business digitization on ecosystem vitality. the roles of digital skills and business digitization have been seen more clearly during the covid-19 pandemic. by studying the short-run and long-run effects, we indicate that the digital transformation process has adverse effects in the short term, but positive effects appear in the long term. finally, the investigation into the mechanism of the digitalization-environment nexus provides empirical evidence of the influence of digital transformation on the environment and sustainability in the european union.\",\"does data-driven culture impact innovation and performance of a firm? an empirical examination. data-driven culture is considered to bring business-oriented cultural transformation to a firm. it is considered to provide substantial dividends to the firms\\u2019 product and process innovations. recently, several firms have been using different advanced technology-embedded business analytics (ba) tools to improve their business performance. again, advancement of information and communication technology has helped firms to explore the option to use ba tools with artificial intelligence. this has brought radical change in the business-oriented cultural landscape of the firms to arrive at accurate decision-making to improve their innovation and performance. in this perspective, the aim of this study is to show how a firm\\u2019s data-driven culture impacts its product and process innovation, which in turn improves its performance and provides better competitive advantage in the current business environment. with the help of background study, a resource-based view model and different theories, a conceptual model has been developed. the conceptual model has been validated with 456 usable responses from the employees of different firms using different business analytics tools. the study highlights that data-driven culture highly influences both product and process innovation, making the firm more competitive in the industry. in this study, leadership support and data-driven culture have been taken as moderators, whereas firm size, firm age and industry type have been taken as control variables.\",\"competitive dynamics, strategic consistency, and organizational survival. this study investigates strategic consistency in competitive behavior. we construct a logically consistent evolutionary model, providing a causal argument to link a level of strategic consistency to long-term organizational survival. according to our results, strategic consistency seems to be related to both organizational survival and the most efficient change over time concerning the key elements of a firm's strategy. one of the benefits of the model is that some of the components and processes may be manipulated through experimental or simulation interventions. this means that the model can be formally tested in future studies and managers can use it to fine-tune patterns of competitive behavior. copyright\",\"digital product innovation management: balancing stability and fluidity through formalization. while an increasing body of research is considering the role of digital product innovation for firms\\u2019 survival, there is still a dearth of studies on how firms can best pursue digital product innovations. the development of these innovations is often accompanied by uncertainty and ambiguity. thus, firms might benefit from the greater clarity and guidance that result from formalization. however, the application of formalized procedures and structures might also lead to the suppression of fluidity, creativity, or change. therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine if formalization at the project level can enhance digital product innovation. a partial duality logic integrating evidence of both the positive and negative effects of formalization builds the fundament for the hypothesized model. we use survey and patent data for a sample of 395 firms operating in the manufacturing industry to test the model. the results suggest the diminishing marginal utility of formalization\\u2014that is, formalization enhances digital product innovation radicalness and digital product innovation performance but with decreasing positive marginal returns. these findings challenge the widespread assumptions on the relationship between formalization and innovation. this new perspective on the relationship between formalization and innovation helps identify conditions in which formalization can facilitate firms\\u2019 efforts to develop profitable, innovative digital products. for example, the results demonstrate that older firms in particular can benefit from formalization. in turn, beyond providing insights for executives, this study offers answers to persistent research questions concerning which organizational arrangements are optimal for enhancing digital product innovation.\",\"analysing customer behaviour in mobile app usage. purpose - big data produced by mobile apps contains valuable knowledge about customers and markets and have been viewed as productive resources. the purpose of this paper is to propose a multiple methods approach to elicit intelligence and value from big data by analysing the customer behaviour in mobile app usage. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach - the big data analytical approach is developed using three data mining techniques: rfm(recency, frequency, monetary) analysis, link analysis, and association rule learning. the authors then conduct a case study to apply this approach to analyse the transaction data extracted from a mobile app. findings - this approach can identify high value and mass customers, and understand their patterns and preferences in using the functions of the mobile app. such knowledge enables the developer to capture the behaviour of large pools of customers and to improve products and services by mixing and matching the functions and offering personalised promotions and marketing information. originality\\u002fvalue - the approach used in this study balances complexity with usability, thus facilitating corporate use of big data in making product improvement and customisation decisions. the approach allows developers to gain insights into customer behaviour and function usage preferences by analysing big data. the identified associations between functions can also help developers improve existing, and design new, products and services to satisfy customers' unfulfilled requirements.\",\"three characteristics of technology competition by iot-driven digitization. the purpose of this paper is to understand changes in the technological competitiveness of countries induced by internet of things (iot)-driven digitization. patent analysis, as one of the best ways to measure technological competitiveness, exhibits three characteristics of iot-driven digitization, namely, agile innovation, stagnation across asian countries, and the resurgence of the u.s., in turn taking advantage of network effects. the agile innovation of iot-driven digitization suggests that digitization relies less on existing technologies and enables the leveraging of opportunities that arise from new order emergence. some asian countries took advantage of agile innovation as a window of opportunity in the previous age of digitization. these countries now lag less behind the u.s. as a result. nevertheless, as these countries experience difficulties in taking advantage of agile innovation in the current age of digitization, they lag further behind the u.s. in terms of iot-driven digitization. the structure of joint patent applications reveals that the u.s. has become a hub between the two european communities, the chinese community and individual pro-american countries, implying that the network effect of iot-driven digitization could have a significant impact on the technological competitiveness of countries.\",\"bibliometric overview of the technological forecasting and social change journal: analysis from 1970 to 2018. the purpose of this paper is to analyze the evolution of technological forecasting and social change journal for a period between 1970 and 2018 for 4248 articles. the growing scope and diversity of the field creates fragmentation and the belief that reviews could contribute to synthesis and integration. this analysis includes key factors impacting growth of a journal such as publication evolution and citation structure, most cited articles, leading authors, institutions and countries, related journals and ranking, key research streams in the journal, and co-citation analysis. factors of the technological forecasting and social change journal determine the relationship between various sub-fields. the analysis also provides key insights about the evolution of the field over time.\",\"industry 4.0: a bibliometric review of its managerial intellectual structure and potential evolution in the service industries. the \\u201cindustry 4.0\\\" phenomenon is expected to influence almost every aspect of business value chains, and hence it has been increasingly analyzed by management scholars. however, the overarching intellectual structure emerging from this new stream of literature has not yet been synthesized in a framework nor critically discussed. furthermore, despite being part of the rhetoric in several recent industrial governmental plans, industry 4.0 in service sectors has not been systematically reviewed to date. by leveraging a systematic quantitative literature review, a data-driven approach and a quantitative methodology\\u2014embedding both bibliographic coupling and network analysis techniques\\u2014this study provides a clear visualization of the emerging intellectual structure of industry 4.0 in management studies. we also develop a framework based on the most recurrent themes emerging from the results of bibliometric and network analyses\\u2014the latter could be used by management scholars to understand studies surrounding industry 4.0. as service businesses can create and capture value generated through the 4th industrial revolution as well as manufacturing firms, we suggest that scholarly attention should also be directed toward the service industries and provide a research agenda.\",\"the development of business model research: a bibliometric review. recent reviews demonstrate the usefulness of the business model concept as a level of analysis in management, whereas less attention has been devoted to the analysis of the paths of past research to guide its future development. we used bibliometric methods, specifically bibliographic coupling and algorithmic historigraphy, to trace the development of the business model literature from its origins in e-business to its current state. in addition to reviewing the literature as a whole, our study investigated the time-dependent co-evolution of research sub-streams. we examined the relative influence of publications and canonical papers (algorithmic historiography) within and between three separate time spans (bibliographic coupling). we found that business model foundations draw from three major business sub-disciplines\\u2014strategy, entrepreneurship, and innovation\\u2014whilst new frontiers (e.g., industry 4.0, sustainability, and networks) offer an opportunity to increase the inter-connectedness of business model research. finally, we discuss contemporary topics and future avenues for business model research.\",\"open innovation for sustainability or not: literature reviews of global research trends. the demand for innovative approaches applied to productive sectors is a reality present in the circular economy and open innovation is a relatively new concept that has revolutionized the literature about innovation management. since the concept appeared in 2003, many articles have focused on its development and application. although some studies have connected open innovation with sustainability, the relevance of this current on the global literature about open innovation is still unidentified. in this context, this paper tries to cover this gap with a bibliometric analysis focused on the evolution of the open innovation paradigm and the relevance of sustainability in this field of research. a sample of 3087 papers published between 2003 and 2019 in the scopus database was obtained. the analysis revealed the main topics and the most prolific journals, authors, institutions, and countries, in terms of productivity, citations, and h-indexes. besides of these contributions, keywords analysis reveals that, in recent years, sustainability and ecosystems are decisive variables in open innovation research.\",\"how digitalization changes our understanding of professional service firms. the digital transformation currently at play changes the conditions for firms across different industries which challenges the way we have previously understood them. as the economy is becoming increasingly knowledge-based and service-oriented, the professional service firms (\\u201cpsfs\\u201d) are of particular importance. being characterized by high knowledge intensity, low capital intensity, and professionalized workforces, these firms have developed certain management practices and organizational forms. however, despite being persistent and remarkably successful over time, psfs are starting to change. this article suggests that digitalization is the driver of these changes and draws on empirical data from law firms to analyze the effects of digitalization on the distinctive characteristics of psfs. the findings show that digitalization enables legal service delivery at lower levels of knowledge intensity, whereas it increases capital intensity for most firms and decreases the professionalization of the workforce. consequently, this article argues that digitalization has changed the distinctive characteristics of psfs, which promotes new practices, allows for variation, and transforms their competitive contexts. in light of these findings, we should reconsider our understanding of psfs.\",\"academic research in innovation: a country analysis. many countries are investing a lot in innovation in order to modernize their economies. a key step in this process is the development of academic research in innovation. this article analyzes the leading countries in innovation research between 1989 and 2013 from an academic perspective. the aim of the study is to identify the most relevant countries in this field and the leading trends that are occurring during the last years. the work also introduces a general perspective analyzing the research developed in several supranational regions. the main advantage of this contribution is that it gives a global overview of the current academic state of the art in the area. the analysis focuses on the most productive and influential countries in innovation research classifying the results in periods of 5 years. the leading journals in the field are also studied individually identifying the most productive countries in each of the journals. the results show that the publications of each country are biased by the country origin of the journal. the usa and the uk are the leading countries in this field being the uk the most productive one in per capita terms among the big countries.\",\"big data for creating and capturing value in the digitalized environment: unpacking the effects of volume, variety, and veracity on firm performance*. despite significant academic and managerial interest in big data, there is a dearth of research on how big data impacts the long-term firm performance. reasons for this gap include a lack of objective indices to measure big data availability and its impact, and the tendency of studies to ignore the costs associated with collecting and analyzing big data, assuming that big data automatically delivers benefits to firms. focusing on how firms create and capture value from big data about customers, we use the resource-based view and three dimensions of big data (i.e., volume, variety, and veracity) to understand when the benefits outweigh the costs. relying on the number of downloads of mobile device applications, we find that volume of big data has a negative effect on firm performance. this result suggests that the \\u201cbigness\\u201d of big data alone does not ensure value creation for a firm, and could even constitute a \\u201cdark side\\u201d of big data. because big data variety\\u2014measured as the number of types of information taken per each application\\u2014moderates the negative effects of big data volume, simultaneous high values of volume and variety allow firms to create value that positively affects their performance. in addition, high levels of veracity (i.e., a high percentage of employees devoted to big data analysis), are linked to firms benefiting from big data via value capture. these findings shed light on the circumstances in which big data can be beneficial for firms, contributing to a better theoretical understanding of the opportunities and challenges and providing useful indications to managers.\",\"the digitalization of agriculture and rural areas: towards a taxonomy of the impacts. the literature about digitalization in agriculture and rural areas is vast and sectorial at the same time. both international political institutions and practitioners are interested in promoting digital technology, indicating and describing potential benefits and risks. meanwhile, academics analyze the actual and possible impacts of digital technologies by using case studies. however, the extensive literature makes it challenging to derive a comprehensive synthesis of the possible impacts that digital technologies are and might generate in the rural domains. in the given context, the present work aims at contributing to the construction of a framework providing a first classification of the digital technologies\\u2019 impacts to use in both research and a political agenda.\",\"key challenges in the search for the effective management of knowledge in management consulting firms. consulting firms cite knowledge management as a core capability for achieving competitive advantage. consistent with this claim has been their increasing investment in systems that seek to formalize knowledge management and allow firms to leverage the knowledge held within the firm. however, despite some successes, knowledge management remains a major challenge. investigates this situation, using a framework that distinguishes between input and output challenges. input challenges relate to the production of a knowledge base that is able to be shared within the firm. output challenges relate to the capacity for effective utilization of any such knowledge base. concludes with a discussion of the way in which changes in the pattern of consulting services has implications for the sort of knowledge that various consulting firms wish to codify, the dangers associated with codification and the means by which these can be managed.\",\"analytics-based decision-making for service systems: a qualitative study and agenda for future research. while the use of big data tends to add value for business throughout the entire value chain, the integration of big data analytics (bda) to the decision-making process remains a challenge. this study, based on a systematic literature review, thematic analysis and qualitative interview findings, proposes a set of six-steps to establish both rigor and relevance in the process of analytics-driven decision-making. our findings illuminate the key steps in this decision process including problem definition, review of past findings, model development, data collection, data analysis as well as actions on insights in the context of service systems. although findings have been discussed in a sequence of steps, the study identifies them as interdependent and iterative. the proposed six-step analytics-driven decision-making process, practical evidence from service systems, and future research agenda, provide altogether the foundation for future scholarly research and can serve as a step-wise guide for industry practitioners.\",\"a bibliographic study on big data: concepts, trends and challenges. purpose: the purpose of paper is twofold. first, it provides a consolidated overview of the existing literature on \\u201cbig data\\u201d and second, it presents the current trends and opens up various future directions for researchers who wish to explore and contribute in this rapidly evolving field. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: to achieve the objective of this study, the bibliographic and network techniques of citation and co-citation analysis was adopted. this analysis involved an assessment of 57 articles published over a period of five years (2011-2015) in ten selected journals. findings: the findings reveal that the number of articles devoted to the study of \\u201cbig data\\u201d has increased rapidly in recent years. moreover, the study identifies some of the most influential articles of this area. finally, the paper highlights the new trends and discusses the challenges associated with big data. research limitations\\u002fimplications: this study focusses only on big data concepts, trends, and challenges and excludes research on its analytics. thus, researchers may explore and extend this area of research. originality\\u002fvalue: to the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to review the literature on big data by using citation and co-citation analysis.\",\"understanding the impact of cloud-based services adoption on organizational flexibility: an exploratory study. purpose \\u2013 the purpose of this paper is to explore the factors that drive the adoption of cloud-based services and further understand the impact of this adoption on the organizational flexibility. this study presents information technology executive\\u2019s perspective and discovers new constructs of organizational flexibility that can be achieved due to the adoption of cloud-based services, which is the main contribution of this paper. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach \\u2013 this study uses in-depth interview approach. total 21 indian cases were studied by interacting with respondents having similar profiles (i.e. cios, ctos, technology heads, and systems managers). based on the literature review a semi-structured questionnaire was prepared and administered through in-depth interviews. findings \\u2013 analysis of data reveals that cloud-based services provide relative advantage in terms of scalability, accessibility, and on-demand deployment of services within no time. easy to use

internal r&d and external knowledge acquisition: absorptive capacity dynamics over time. an important challenge in open innovation is the capability to absorb and exploit external inbound knowledge, and how internal r&d may facilitate or hinder this. conventionally, internal r&d expenditure is used as a proxy for absorptive capacity, but in the context of open innovation, this can be problematic. internal r&d may also constrain present and future absorption, and restrict exploitation for a number of reasons, e.g. degree of development, structural, geographical or relevance to existing business units and markets. conversely, external sources of innovation can be difficult to identify, evaluate and absorb, but may be more codified, as by definition they are available in the market, and more fully-developed to demonstrate commercial potential. using panel data of 325 firms over five years, we find that contrary to the prescriptions of transaction cost analysis, externally-sourced knowledge takes less time to absorb and exploit than internally-generated knowledge, but that internal knowledge creates higher returns over the longer term. significantly, the relationship between internal and external knowledge and performance changes over time, while the ideal strategic balance needs to consider decisions taken at different times.\",\"when decision support systems fail: insights for strategic information systems from formula 1. decision support systems (dss) are sophisticated tools that increasingly take advantage of big data and are used to design and implement individual- and organization-level strategic decisions. yet, when organizations excessively rely on their potential the outcome may be decision-making failure, particularly when such tools are applied under high pressure and turbulent conditions. partial understanding and unidimensional interpretation can prevent learning from failure. building on a practice perspective, we study an iconic case of strategic failure in formula 1 racing. our approach, which integrates the decision maker as well as the organizational and material context, identifies three interrelated sources of strategic failure that are worth investigation for decision-makers using dss and big data: (1) the situated nature and affordances of decision-making; (2) the distributed nature of cognition in decision-making; and (3) the performativity of the dss. we outline specific research questions and their implications for firm performance and competitive advantage. finally, we advance an agenda that can help close timely gaps in strategic is research.\",\"exploring the dark and unexpected sides of digitalization: toward a critical agenda. digitalization has far-reaching implications for individuals, organizations, and society. while extant management and organization studies mainly focus on the positive aspects of this development, the dark and potentially unexpected sides of digitalization for organizations and organizing have received less scholarly attention. this special issue extends this emerging debate. drawing on empirical material of platform corporations, social movements, and traditional corporations, eight articles illuminate the various negative implications of the digitalization of work and organization processes, particularly for workers, employees, and activists. in this introduction, we contextualize these valuable contributions that underline the dangers of the ubiquity and simultaneity of digitalization and begin to sketch out potential avenues toward a comprehensive critical agenda of digitalization in organization studies.\",\"digital transformation and sustainable performance: the moderating role of market turbulence. as digital technologies disrupt one sector after another, many companies are actively embracing digital transformation. however, the relationship between digital transformation and sustainable performance remains unclear. to fill this gap, based on an integrated perspective of dynamic capability and organizational inertia, this study examines the curvilinear relationships between digital transformation and economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable performance. survey data from 223 chinese companies articulate that although digital transformation fosters economic performance at an accelerating rate, it depicts an inverse u-shaped relationship with environmental performance. more interestingly, the accelerating rate of digital transformation on economic performance is quicker under low market turbulence. in contrast, when market turbulence is high, higher digital transformation is associated with worse environmental performance. this study contributes to the literature by providing new theoretical explanations for the inconsistent relationship between digital transformation and sustainable performance. this study also assists companies in re-evaluating their digital strategies.\",\"a bibliometric review of finance bibliometric papers. as bibliometric approaches are increasingly a focus of literature reviews across different business disciplines, we apply a bibliometric approach to a review of bibliometric studies in finance, assessing 121 bibliometric studies. we identify four literature clusters: studies focusing on assessments of literature in trending topics; analysis of papers that employ emerging econometric techniques; studies grouped around particular fundamental topics such as market dynamics, behavioral finance, and corporate governance; and studies focused on retrospective celebration of single well-known finance journals. we identify which countries, institutions, and scholars have been being particularly influential. results suggest that the field of economics has been more comfortable publishing bibliometric studies than finance. results also identify the mainstream finance journals that are particularly leading in publishing bibliometric studies, with results showing that these journals have particularly high-growing scholarly impact. we conclude that bibliometric studies are an important vehicle for highlighting and motivating emerging scholarship.\",\"business intelligence and analytics use, innovation ambidexterity, and firm performance: a dynamic capabilities perspective. to survive in a dynamic and hyper-competitive business environment, firms are compelled to simultaneously introduce incremental and radical innovations. while it is recognised that business intelligence and analytics (bi&a) can support innovation and provide organisational value, the literature provides a limited understanding of its impact on balancing different innovation activities and ensuring performance gains. in this study, we examine the relationship between bi&a use, innovation ambidexterity, and firm performance by relying on the process theory of is value creation as well as the dynamic capabilities perspective. we test our model using data collected from medium- and large-sized firms in slovenia, applying partial least squares modelling. the results support the notion that bi&a use is positively associated with successful balancing between explorative and exploitative innovation activities, which in turn enhances firm performance. our results also indicate that innovation ambidexterity is enhanced in two ways: indirectly through interaction with the firm's absorptive capacity, and directly by increasing the possibilities of faster experimentation with offerings of products or services and improved predictability of the value of new products or services.\",\"digital transformation and convergence toward the 2030 agenda\\u2019s sustainability development goals: evidence from italian listed firms. the united nations 2030 agenda has emphasized the potential of digital technology to enhance sustainability performance, assuming that digital transformation can enable firms\\u2019 convergence toward the sustainable development goals. despite this, the literature is unclear regarding whether there is a positive relationship between digitalization and sustainability, as the effects of digital transformation are controversial. the main goal of this study was to assess the hypothesis that digital technology contributes to the achievement of sustainable development goals within the un 2030 agenda. to test this hypothesis, a textual analysis was performed to assess italian firms\\u2019 digitalization efforts; the obtained results were then related to the selected firms\\u2019 esg scores using a regression analysis. the analysis focused on italian ftse mib listed firms for the period 2016\\u2013 2019. the findings show a positive relation between digitalization and sustainable development goals, highlighting the relevance of digital technology in implementing the sustainability agenda.\",\"what are socially disruptive technologies?. scholarly discourse on \\u201cdisruptive technologies\\u201d has been strongly influenced by disruptive innovation theory. this theory is tailored for analyzing disruptions in markets and business. it is of limited use, however, in analyzing the broader social, moral and existential dynamics of technosocial disruption. yet these broader dynamics should be of great scholarly concern, both in coming to terms with technological disruptions of the past and those of our current age. technologies can disrupt social relations, institutions, epistemic paradigms, foundational concepts, values, and even the nature of human cognition and experience \\u2013 domains of disruption that are largely neglected in existing discourse on disruptive technologies. accordingly, this paper seeks to reorient scholarly discussion around a broader notion of technosocial disruption. this broader notion raises three foundational questions. first, how can technosocial disruption be conceptualized in a way that clearly sets it apart from the disruptive innovation framework? secondly, how does the notion of technosocial disruption relate to the concordant notions of \\u201cdisruptor\\u201d and \\u201cdisruptiveness\\u201d? thirdly, can we advance criteria to assess the \\u201cdegree of social disruptiveness\\u201d of different technologies? the paper clarifies these questions and proposes an answer to each of them. in doing so, it advances \\u201ctechnosocial disruption\\u201d as a key analysandum for future scholarship on the interactions between technology and society.\",\"avoid being the turkey: how big data analytics changes the game of strategy in times of ambiguity and uncertainty. in order for organisations to remain competitive in times of ambiguity and uncertainty, there is a need to detect and anticipate unknown unknowns, also called \\u2018black swans\\u2019. when these are ignored they may lead to competitive struggles. in this paper, we build on this view and suggest that big data analytics can provide necessary insights to help change strategy making. research suggests that ambidextrous organisations should focus on developing and maintaining their dynamic capabilities. following on from this, we take a dynamic capabilities perspective and propose a theoretical framework to explain the intricacies of big data analytics. this framework explains the ability of organisations to detect, anticipate and respond strategically in ambiguous and uncertain business environments. for a meta-synthesis of 101 cases of big data analytics, we employ a multi-method approach that incorporates natural language processing, semantic analysis and case analysis, allowing extraction and analysis of structured information from unstructured data. overall, we find evidence of big data analytics helping to detect, anticipate and respond to industry disruption. we offer six propositions about the relationships between the levels of data analytics capabilities and strategic dynamic capabilities. we find that descriptive data analytics improves the capability of an organisation to understand the business context (sensing) and that predictive data analytics aids in the realisation of business opportunities (seizing). this study contributes to an understanding of big data analytics as a dynamic organisational capability that supports strategic decision-making in times of ambiguity and uncertainty. we conclude by suggesting areas for further investigation, particularly in regard to the strategic application of prescriptive data analytics.\",\"technology roadmapping for competitive technical intelligence. understanding the evolution and emergence of technology domains remains a challenge, particularly so for potentially breakthrough technologies. though it is well recognized that emergence of new fields is complex and uncertain, to make decisions amidst such uncertainty, one needs to mobilize various sources of intelligence to identify known\\u2013knowns and known\\u2013unknowns to be able to choose appropriate strategies and policies. this competitive technical intelligence cannot rely on simple trend analyses because breakthrough technologies have little past to inform such trends, and positing the directions of evolution is challenging. neither do qualitative tools, embracing the complexities, provide all the solutions, since transparent and repeatable techniques need to be employed to create best practices and evaluate the intelligence that comes from such exercises. in this paper, we present a hybrid roadmapping technique that draws on a number of approaches and integrates them into a multi-level approach (individual activities, industry evolutions and broader global changes) that can be applied to breakthrough technologies. we describe this approach in deeper detail through a case study on dye-sensitized solar cells. our contribution to this special issue is to showcase the technique as part of a family of approaches that are emerging around the world to inform strategy and policy.\",\"digital entrepreneurship platforms: mapping the field and looking towards a holistic approach. entrepreneurship is widely advocated as a driver of innovation and economic growth. given today's technological and digital challenges, digital entrepreneurship in particular is a phenomenon on the rise, both through the digitization of existing businesses and the creation of digital enterprises. debates on the relevance of digital entrepreneurship have been published in a range of journals that vary in terms of their purpose and readership. as such, scholarly contributions to this topic remain largely fragmented. to address this gap, this review aims to map academic literature on digital entrepreneurship in order to facilitate a better understanding of antecedents and future work. this study combines bibliometric approaches to examine literature on digital entrepreneurship platforms, forming a holistic picture of the field's different aspects and trends. the content and thematic analysis of 97 articles allows us to identify five approaches: i) digital entrepreneurship success factors, ii) digital entrepreneurial ecosystems and smart cities, iii) digital entrepeneurial models, iv) sharing entrepreneurial platforms, and v) digital platforms about entrepreneurship co-creation. our findings further highlight the various gaps in digital entrepreneurship literature and raise some research questions that warrant future academic research. our holistic model holds several implications for the theory and practice of the different aspects of digital entrepreneurship.\",\"the role of big data analytics capabilities in bolstering supply chain

capabilities relationship and firm performance. in this context, some theoretical and managerial implications are proposed and discussed.\",\"investments in big data analytics and firm performance: an empirical investigation of direct and mediating effects. big data has recently been recognised as one of the most important areas of future technology. it has attracted the attention of many industries, since it has the potential to provide companies with high business value. this paper examines the forms of business value that companies can create from big data analytics investments, the direct impacts it has on the financial performance of a firm, and the mediating effects of market performance and customer satisfaction. drawing on the resource-based view theory, this study demonstrates that the business value achieved from investments in big data analytics leads to advantages in terms of the financial performance of a firm. the results offer evidence of the existence of a customer satisfaction mediation effect and of the absence of a market performance mediation effect. theoretical and practical implications are discussed at the end of the paper.\",\"an exploratory

with customers (crm), continuous learning and development of new products and potential innovation.\",\"digitalization and the geographies of production: towards reshoring or global fragmentation?. the relationship between digitalization and the governance and geographies of global value chains has not been explored systematically. this contribution discusses how digitalization affects the variables that determine the localization of manufacturing, i.e. the substitution of work through automation, the deepening of the customer\\u2013producer relationship, the rationalization of distribution through digitalized logistics networks, and the increased modularization of supply chains through standardization and \\u2018platformisation\\u2019. the results of the theoretical exploration defy expectations of a straightforward \\u2018reshoring\\u2019 of production through the combined effects of automation and benefits through a co-localization of companies within their target markets. tendencies that would support a stronger integration of production in advanced economies are instead being undercut by ongoing countertrends towards fragmentation. the contradictory tendencies of a geographical integration of manufacturing and target markets on the one hand and geographical fragmentation through sophisticated supply-chain organization on the other will affect the technologically facilitated processes of value chain restructuring in a sector-specific manner.\",\"quality dominant logic in big data analytics and firm performance. purpose: big data analytics (bda) gets all the attention these days, but as important\\u2014and perhaps even more important\\u2014is big data analytics quality (bdaq). although many companies realize a full return from bda, others clearly struggle. it appears that quality dynamics and their holistic impact on firm performance are unresolved in data economy. the purpose of this paper is to draw on the resource-based view and information systems quality to develop a bdaq model and measure its impact on firm performance. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the study uses an online survey to collect data from 150 panel members in france from a leading market research firm. the participants in the study were business analysts and it managers with analytics experience. findings: the study confirms that perceived technology, talent and information quality are significant determinants of bdaq. it also identifies that alignment between analytics quality and firm strategy moderates the relationship between bdaq and firm performance. practical implications: the findings inform practitioners that bdaq is a hierarchical, multi-dimensional and context-specific model. originality\\u002fvalue: the study advances theoretical understanding of the relationship between bdaq and firm performance under the influence of firm strategy alignment.\",\"a dynamic capability view of marketing analytics: evidence from uk firms. while marketing analytics plays an important role in generating insights from big data to improve marketing decision-making and firm competitiveness, few academic studies have investigated the mechanisms through which it can be used to achieve sustained competitive advantage. to close this gap, this study draws on the dynamic capability view to posit that a firm can attain sustained competitive advantage from its sensing, seizing and reconfiguring capabilities, which are manifested by the use of marketing analytics, marketing decision-making, and product development management. this study also examines the impact of the antecedents of marketing analytics use on marketing related processes. the analysis of a survey of 221 uk firm managers demonstrates: (a) the positive impact of marketing analytics use on both marketing decision-making and product development management; (b) the effect of the latter two on sustained competitive advantage; (c) the indirect effect of data availability on both marketing decision-making and production development management; and (d) the indirect effect of managerial support on marketing decision-making. the research model proposed in this study provides insights into how marketing analytics can be used to achieve sustained competitive advantage.\",\"increasing the effectiveness of procurement decisions: the value of big data in the procurement process. big data are a commonly discussed topic, and their value in marketing and sales has been thoroughly investigated. although some authors have also discussed their relevance to purchasing and supply management, the literature on this topic remains scant. this paper aims to investigate the role of big data in supporting the procurement process and the implementation of procurement practices. the main benefits of such procurement practices for companies are highlighted. by presenting the results of a focus group of procurement professionals and experts and discussing four exploratory case studies (supported by secondary data analysis), the paper addresses 1) how (and in which format) big data affects different activities in the procurement process and 2) which benefits procurement professionals can expect from adopting big data.\",\"unlocking the power of big data in new product development. this study explores how big data can be used to enable customers to express unrecognised needs. by acquiring this information, managers can gain opportunities to develop customer-centred products. big data can be defined as multimedia-rich and interactive low-cost information resulting from mass communication. it offers customers a better understanding of new products and provides new, simplified modes of large-scale interaction between customers and firms. although previous studies have pointed out that firms can better understand customers\\u2019 preferences and needs by leveraging different types of available data, the situation is evolving, with increasing application of big data analytics for product development, operations and supply chain management. in order to utilise the customer information available from big data to a larger extent, managers need to identify how to establish a customer-involving environment that encourages customers to share their ideas with managers, contribute their know-how, fiddle around with new products, and express their actual preferences. we investigate a new product development project at an electronics company, ste, and describe how big data is used to connect to, interact with and involve customers in new product development in practice. our findings reveal that big data can offer customer involvement so as to provide valuable input for developing new products. in this paper, we introduce a customer involvement approach as a new means of coming up with customer-centred new product development.\",\"meta-synthesis of qualitative case studies: an approach to theory building. the purpose of this article is to provide the research design of a meta-synthesis of qualitative case studies. the meta-synthesis aims at building theory out of primary qualitative case studies that have not been planned as part of a unified multisite effect. by drawing on an understanding of research synthesis as the interpretation of qualitative evidence from a postpositivistic perspective, this article proposes eight steps of synthesizing existing qualitative case study findings to build theory. an illustration of the application of this method in the field of dynamic capabilities is provided. after enumerating the options available to meta-synthesis researchers, the potential challenges as well as the prospects of this research design are discussed.\",\"big data analysis adaptation and enterprises\\u2019 competitive advantages: the perspective of dynamic capability and resource-based theories. big data analysis (bda) adaptation has been spreading unprecedentedly fast among chinese enterprises to gain a competitive advantage. based on the resource-based theory (rbt) and dynamic capability theory (dct), this study aims to propose a conceptual model to identify the sources of competitive advantages, interrelationship of their components, and the mechanism of obtaining competitive advantage. the results reveal several important findings. 1) different dimensions of dynamic capabilities all have effects on competitive advantage, but they have different paths to influence these. 2) two dimensions of dynamic capabilities have direct effects on the competitive advantages, and strategy flexibility has indirect effects on these. 3) three dimensions of resources all indirectly and positively influence competitive advantages by affecting dynamic capabilities. 4) the path of resources and dynamic capabilities affecting competitive advantage are identified. the findings have important implications for managers that leverage bda to achieve comparative advantages in business.\",\"digital transformation: five recommendations for the digitally conscious firm. digital transformation is one of the key challenges facing contemporary businesses. the need to leverage digital technology to develop and implement new business models forces firms to reevaluate existing capabilities, structures, and culture in order to identify what technologies are relevant and how they will be enacted in organizational processes and business offerings. more often than not, these profound changes require firms to revisit old truths as they develop strategies that thread the needle between beneficial innovation and harmful disruption. this article uses the internet of things (iot) as a backdrop to demonstrate the concerns associated with transformative technologies and offers five recommendations as to how firms can develop the strategies needed for digital transformation and become digitally conscious: (1) start small and build on firsthand benefits; (2) team up and create competitive advantage from brand recognition; (3) engage in standardization efforts; (4) take responsibility for data ownership and ethics; and (5) own the change and ensure organization-wide commitment. as such, this article shows that digital transformation should be a top management priority and a defining trait of corporate business strategy, and that by becoming digitally conscious, firms may get a head start on their transformation journey.\",\"do external knowledge sourcing modes matter for service innovation? empirical evidence from south korean service firms. to source external knowledge, firms in the service area use various sourcing modes simultaneously suitable for their internal needs or external environments. each external knowledge sourcing mode has distinctive characteristics, and as such, they can offer different advantages and\\u002for disadvantages to the firms. thus, the effects of external knowledge sourcing on service innovation may vary depending on the sourcing modes. the current study aims to empirically examine the different effects of various external knowledge sourcing modes on service innovation. the study identifies three external knowledge sourcing modes: joint development, technology purchasing, and external information acquisition. three hypotheses are established to examine the relationships between the extent of utilizing each mode and service innovation performance in terms of new service introduction. the data for analysis are selected from the \\\"korean innovation survey 2006: service sector\\\" (kis 2006). it is regarded as south korea's version of the community innovation survey (cis). the kis 2006 data set covers joint development, technology purchasing, and external information acquisition activities of corporations in the service sector in south korea. the study empirically analyzes the data set using a negative binomial regression model. the results first demonstrate that the extent of the joint development has an inverted u-shaped relationship with the service innovation performance. second, the results indicate that, on the other hand, service innovation performance decreases with the increase to the extent of the technology purchasing when the extent is below the threshold. on the other hand, it increases with the increase to the extent of the technology purchasing; this occurs when the extent exceeds the threshold. third, the results show that external information acquisition has a positive effect on service innovation performance. these findings support that the extent of utilizing each mode has different relationships with service innovation performance. the findings suggest that service firms need to utilize joint development at a moderate level, active technology purchasing, and as much external information acquisition as possible to maximize service innovation performance. in practice, this finding can help managers of service firms select appropriate external knowledge sourcing modes and determine the optimum level of use for each mode. this study also can help firms build up strategies for external knowledge sourcing.\",\"data as an asset: what the oil and gas sector can learn from other industries about \\\"big data\\\". the upstream oil and gas industry has been contending with massive data sets and monolithic files for many years, but \\\"big data\\\" is a relatively new concept that has the potential to significantly re-shape the industry. despite the impressive amount of value that is being realized by big data technologies in other parts of the marketplace, however, much of the data collected within the oil and gas sector tends to be discarded, ignored, or analyzed in a very cursory way. this viewpoint examines existing data management practices in the upstream oil and gas industry, and compares them to practices and philosophies that have emerged in organizations that are leading the way in big data. the comparison shows that, in companies that are widely considered to be leaders in big data analytics, data is regarded as a valuable asset-but this is usually not true within the oil and gas industry insofar as data is frequently regarded there as descriptive information about a physical asset rather than something that is valuable in and of itself. the paper then discusses how the industry could potentially extract more value from data, and concludes with a series of policy-related questions to this end.\",\"the international biotechnology industry: a dynamic capabilities perspective. this paper extends our understanding of the diffusion of technology across firms and nations. the dynamic capabilities perspective in its micro and macro version provides the theoretical framework for an explanation of the international organization of the biotechnology industry. we address two interrelated aspects of the phenomenon of international diffusion: organizational form and geographical flows. an examination of the empirical profile lends support to the dynamic capabilities argument.\",\"trends and patterns in sustainable entrepreneurship research: a bibliometric review and research agenda. sustainable entrepreneurship (se) has attracted significant scholarly attention over the last decade. given its rapid development and its multidisciplinary character, the se literature is increasingly difficult to navigate. we combine two bibliometric approaches (i.e. co-citation analysis of references and bibliographic coupling of documents) with manual coding of documents to take stock of progress within the field, mapping out focal points as well as blind spots in the se research agenda. we show how distinct subfields have formed around key ideas expressed in subsets of seminal papers, shedding light on the relational nature of knowledge creation \\u2013 uncovering the characteristics, evolution and future trajectories of these subfields. we develop a future research agenda based on the developments of the overall field as well as the subfields of se.\",\"how do digital capabilities affect firm performance? the mediating role of technological capabilities in the \\u201cnew normal\\u201d. this study proposes a model to explain the effect of digital capabilities on firm performance in the \\u201cnew normal\\u201d context from a firm-level perspective. moreover, it analyzes the mediating role of technological capabilities and the human development index (hdi) in explaining firm performance. our study used data from the world bank's enterprise surveys 2020, which included 999 firms from 27 countries. we applied the methodological approach, partial least square structural equation modeling (pls-sem), to test the hypothetical model. the results show that digital capabilities positively influence firm performance only through technological capabilities. we also empirically demonstrate that digital skills in low hdi economies have a more significant indirect effect on firm performance than in high hdi countries. finally, some promising avenues for future research and implications for managers and policymakers are suggested based on these findings.\",\"the indian software industry and its evolving service capability. this paper examines the growth of dynamic capabilities among firms in the indian software industry by looking in some detail at the changing constraints, opportunities and competition facing incumbent firms. it emphasizes the important role played by tight

disruptions in society, industry, and organizations stimulated by advances in digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data analytics, cloud computing, and the internet of things (iot). presently, there is a lack of studies to map digital transformation in the environmental sustainability domain. this paper identifies the disruptions driven by digital transformation in the environmental sustainability domain through a systematic literature review. the results present a framework that outlines the transformations in four key areas: pollution control, waste management, sustainable production, and urban sustaina-bility. the transformations in each key area are divided into further sub\\u2010categories. this study pro-poses an agenda for future research in terms of organizational capabilities, performance, and digital transformation strategy regarding environmental sustainability.\",\"a case study on the implementation of a knowledge management strategy oriented to innovation: a knowledge management strategy oriented to innovation. a critical aspect of business management is the successful creation of processes which drive the development of a continuous flow of innovation, to give a basis for competitive advantage. to reach this goal, the establishing of a knowledge management (km) strategy may be considered the best way to channel the organization's efforts to this end. knowledge management is understood in a wide sense as a process of overall change in the organization, focused on innovation, and especially related to the participation of every employee in the processes of creation and transmission of knowledge. this study analyzes the implementation of an innovation and km strategy in the irizar company, a maker of luxury coach bodywork. according to the economist intelligence unit, irizar is the most efficient company in the world in its sector. irizar's success has been built on a system of self-management and participation, organizing its activity into processes and using multidisciplinary work teams. this type of organization has outstripped the traditional model, based on functions and the division of labour, and has permitted a centering of effort on those activities which add value. another defining characteristic of irizar is its combination of continuous improvement with radical changes and process re-engineering. a series of organizational factors are extracted from the case study which were successful in implementing the strategy. the study shows how the organization achieved the promotion of experience transmission and the generation of continuous innovation. it also makes clear that the firm's values and corporate culture are essential for success in this process.\",\"big data adoption: state of the art and research challenges. big data adoption is a process through which businesses find innovative ways to enhance productivity and predict risk to satisfy customers need more efficiently. despite the increase in demand and importance of big data adoption, there is still a lack of comprehensive review and classification of the existing studies in this area. this research aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state-of-the-art by highlighting theoretical models, the influence factors, and the research challenges of big data adoption. by adopting a systematic selection process, twenty studies were identified in the domain of big data adoption and were reviewed in order to extract relevant information that answers a set of research questions. according to the findings, technology\\u2013organization\\u2013environment and diffusion of innovations are the most popular theoretical models used for big data adoption in various domains. this research also revealed forty-two factors in technology, organization, environment, and innovation that have a significant influence on big data adoption. finally, challenges found in the current research about big data adoption are represented, and future research directions are recommended. this study is helpful for researchers and stakeholders to take initiatives that will alleviate the challenges and facilitate big data adoption in various fields.\",\"open innovation and social big data for sustainability: evidence from the tourism industry. this paper aims to contribute to the debate on open innovation in the age of big data by shedding new light on the role that social networks can play as enabling platforms for tourists' involvement and sources for the creation and management of valuable knowledge assets. the huge amount of data generated on social media by tourists related to their travel experiences can be a valid source of open innovation. to achieve this aim, this paper presents evidence of a digital tourism experience, through a longitudinal case study of a destination in apulia, a southern european region. the findings of the study demonstrate how social big data could open up innovation processes that could be of support in defining sustainable tourism experiences in a destination.\",\"real-time big data processing for instantaneous marketing decisions: a problematization approach. the collection of big data from different sources such as the internet of things, social media and search engines has created significant opportunities for business-to-business (b2b) industrial marketing organizations to take an analytical view in developing programmatic marketing approaches for online display advertising. cleansing, processing and analyzing of such large datasets create challenges for marketing organizations \\u2014 particularly for real-time decision making and comparative implications. importantly, there is limited research for such interplays. by utilizing a problematization approach, this paper contributes through the exploration of links between big data, programmatic marketing and real-time processing and relevant decision making for b2b industrial marketing organizations that depend on big data-driven marketing or big data-savvy managers. this exploration subsequently encompasses appropriate big data sources and effective batch and real-time processing linked with structured and unstructured datasets that influence relative processing techniques. consequently, along with directions for future research, the paper develops interdisciplinary dialogues that overlay computer-engineering frameworks such as apache storm and hadoop within b2b marketing viewpoints and their implications for contemporary marketing practices.\",\"the effects of digital transformation on firm performance: evidence from china\\u2019s manufacturing sector. with vast potentials in improving operations and stimulating growth, digital transformation has aroused much attention from firms across the world. however, the high costs associated with the transformation can not be ignored. limited research has looked into the organizational performance effects of digital transformation. after examining the benefits and costs of digital trans-formation, this research makes an empirical study on the impact of digital transformation on firm operational and financial performance. the panel data from 2010 to 2020 of 2254 manufacturing companies in china suggests that the intensity of digital transformation is in positive correlation with the process-based operating performance, and in the u-shaped correlation with the profit-oriented financial performance. further, we find that digital transformation has a much more lasting impact on operating performance than on financial performance. the conditions required (i.e., policy and innovation environment) to improve the operating performance via digital transformation are more easing. this research shows the differentiated effect of digital transformation on different dimensions of organizational performance and provides guidance for companies to set the goals for digital transformation.\",\"big data analytics as a roadmap towards green innovation, competitive advantage and environmental performance. big data analytics (bda) have been emerged as an important instrument to support firms suffering from sustainability issues. bda could enhance environmental performance of the manufacturing sector but empirical studies on it lack in literature.

ep. chinese manufacturing sector needs to develop appropriate measures to combat sustainability issues and to boost the adoption of bda.\",\"big data dreams: a framework for corporate strategy. the phenomenon of big data\\u2014large, diverse, complex, and\\u002for longitudinal data sets\\u2014is having a stark influence on organizational strategy making. an increase in levels of data and technological capabilities is redefining innovation, competition, and productivity. this article contributes to both practical strategic application and academic research in the strategic management domain by presenting a framework that identifies how big data improves functional capabilities within organizations, shapes entirely new industries, and is a key component of innovative and disruptive strategies used by learning organizations to diversify and break down barriers of traditionally defined industries. this framework provides an appropriate basis for internal corporate strategy discussions that surround big data investments by explaining how firms create value through various approaches. in addition, we offer guidance for how firms might derive their own big data approach through the merits of aligning data strategy aspirations with data strategy authenticity.\",\"exploring digital servitization trajectories within product\\u2013service\\u2013software space. purpose: this study shows various pathways manufacturers can take when embarking on digital servitization (ds) journeys. it builds on the ds and modularity literature to map the strategic trajectories of product\\u2013service\\u2013software (pssw) configurations. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the study is exploratory and based on the inductive theory building method. the empirical data were gathered through a workshop with focus groups of 15 servitization manufacturers (with 22 respondents), an on-site workshop (in-depth case study), semi-structured interviews, observations and document study of archival data. findings: the ds trajectories are idiosyncratic and dependent on design architectures of pssw modules, balancing choices between standardization and innovation. the adoption of software systems depends on the maturity of the industry-specific digital ecosystem. decomposition and integration of pssw modules facilitate ds transition through business model modularity. seven testable propositions are presented. research limitations\\u002fimplications: with the small sample size from different industries and one in-depth case study, generalizing the findings was not possible. practical implications: the mapping exercise is powerful when top management from different functional departments can participate together to share their expertise and achieve consensus. it logs the \\u201cstates\\u201d that the manufacturer undergoes over time. originality\\u002fvalue: the digital servitization cube serves as a conceptual framework for manufacturers to systematically map and categorize their current and future pssw strategies. it bridges the cross-disciplinary theoretical discussion in ds.\",\"mining the r&d innovation performance processes for high-tech firms based on rough set theory. the research and development (r&d) innovation of firms continues to be viewed as an important source of competitive advantage to academics and practitioners. to explore and extract the r&d innovation decision rules, it is important to understand how the r&d innovation rule-base works. however, many studies have not yet adequately induced and extracted the decision rule of r&d innovation and performance based on the characteristics and components of the original data rather than on post-determination models. the analysis of this study is grounded in the taxonomy of induction-related activities using a rough set theory approach or rule-based decision-making technique to infer r&d innovation decision rules and models linking r&d innovation to sales growth. the rules developed using rough set theory can be directly translated into a path-dependent flow network to infer decision paths and parameters. the flow network graph and cause-and-effect relationship of decision rules are heavily exploited in r&d innovation characteristics. in addition, an empirical case of r&d innovation performance will be illustrated to show that the rough sets model and the flow network graph are useful and efficient tools for building r&d innovation decision rules and providing predictions. we will then illustrate that integrating the flow network graph with rough set theory can fully reflect the characteristics of r&d innovation, and, through the established model, we can obtain a more reasonable result than with artificial influence. crown copyright\",\"designing the digital organization. increasingly, organizations are assessing their opportunities, developing and delivering products and services, and interacting with customers and other stakeholders digitally. mobile computing, social media, and big data are the drivers of the future workplace, and these and other digitally based technologies are having large economic and social impacts, including increased competition and collaboration, the disruption of many industries, and pressure being put on organizations to develop new capabilities and transform their cultures. in this article, we provide a conceptual framework for the design of effective digital organizations. our framework is predicated on the current state of digitization across diverse sectors of the global economy. in the digital world, all activities and transactions leave digital marks, and all actors, things, and places can be reached and affected digitally. as a result, we can design for self-organization rather than using hierarchical mechanisms for control and coordination. such designs require the strategic and cultural alignment of digital technologies within the organization and externally with stakeholders. we propose that \\u201cactor-oriented\\u201d principles are at the heart of designing digital organizations and that, if properly applied, can result in a workplace where organization members are highly engaged and productive.\",\"the economics of smart city policies. remarkable academic interest and substantial funding from national and supranational bodies have been concentrating on the topic of smart cities; consequently, smart city policies have attracted large amounts of funding. however, no empirical evidence is to date available on the economic rationale of these policies. in particular, while few studies deal with the impact of smart urban characteristics and policies on urban performance, to date the link between smart features and policies, on the one hand, and urban performance on the other, has never been explored. in this paper we address this gap by empirically verifying whether smart urban policies foster urban economic growth. we assume that, although smart urban characteristics are growth-enhancing in the long run, they have only an indirect effect on urban performance. this assumption is tested by means of an instrumental variables approach whereby urban performance is explained by smart urban policies, along with a set of control variables. the model is tested on a database of 309 european metropolitan areas, collected for this analysis and containing information on both smart urban characteristics and the intensity of smart policies. our empirical results suggest that smart city policy intensity is associated with a better urban economic performance. moreover, instrumenting smart policies with smart urban characteristics suggests that the causality direction goes from policy intensity to growth, and not vice versa (thus ruling out reverse causality). policy suggestions based on these findings are finally provided.\",\"an analytic infrastructure for harvesting big data to enhance supply chain performance. big data has already received a tremendous amount of attention from managers in every industry, policy and decision makers in governments, and researchers in many different areas. however, the current big data analytics have conspicuous limitations, especially when dealing with information silos. in this paper, we synthesise existing researches on big data analytics and propose an integrated infrastructure for breaking down the information silos, in order to enhance supply chain performance. the analytic infrastructure effectively leverages rich big data sources (i.e. databases, social media, mobile and sensor data) and quantifies the related information using various big data analytics. the information generated can be used to identify a required competence set (which refers to a collection of skills and knowledge used for specific problem solving) and to provide roadmaps to firms and managers in generating actionable supply chain strategies, facilitating collaboration between departments, and generating fact-based operational decisions. we showcase the usefulness of the analytic infrastructure by conducting a case study in a world-leading company that produces sports equipment. the results indicate that it enabled managers: (a) to integrate information silos in big data analytics to serve as inputs for new product ideas; (b) to capture and interrelate different competence sets to provide an integrated perspective of the firm's operations capabilities; and (c) to generate a visual decision path that facilitated decision making regarding how to expand competence sets to support new product development.\",\"a multi-dimension framework for value creation through big data. big data represents a promising area for value creation and frontier research. the potential to extract actionable insights from big data has gained increasing attention of both academics and practitioners operating in several industries. marketing domain has become from the start a field for experiments with big data approaches, even if the adoption of big data solutions does not always generate effective value for the adopters. therefore, the gap existing between the potential of value creation embedded in the big data paradigm and the current limited exploitation of this value represents an area of investigation that this paper aims to explore. in particular, by following a systematic literature review, this study aims at presenting a framework that outlines the multiple value directions that the big data paradigm can generate for the adopting organizations. eleven distinct value directions have been identified and then grouped in five dimensions (informational, transactional, transformational, strategic, infrastructural value), which constitute the pillars of the proposed framework. finally, the framework has been also preliminarily applied in three case studies conducted within three italian based companies operating in different industries (e-commerce, fast-moving consumer goods, and banking) in the final aim to see its applicability in real business scenarios.\",\"networking to accelerate the pace of sme innovations. this paper investigates how the time to a firm's first innovation affects the continued pace of innovation and how the networking behaviour of the firm moderates this relationship. in doing so, the paper develops a relationship among three constructs: time to innovation, pace of innovation, and networking. we draw on resource accumulation theory and network theories to develop our hypotheses, which are tested on a sample of 203 smes. the results indicate that the innovation pace of a firm depends on the capabilities developed. by developing innovation capabilities at an early age, firms are likely to drive market changes instead of being challenged by them. firms that lag in the innovation process can compensate for this by actively networking for resources and capabilities.\",\"the drivers of technology licensing: an industry comparison. in the past, most industrial firms focused on applying technology assets in their own products and services. along with the trend towards open innovation, however, many firms have recently started to actively license out technology. these firms consider technology licensing a strategic activity, which may include all technology assets and which goes far beyond a marginal activity of commercializing residual technologies. the research collected for this articles shows that the strategic drivers of technology licensing are often more important than generating licensing revenues. the strategic drivers strengthen the interdependences between internally and externally commercializing technology. product marketing and licensing are complements rather than substitutes in technology exploitation.\",\"foreign direct investment, absorptive capacity and regional innovation capabilities: evidence from china. innovation has widely been regarded as one of the main drivers of economic growth in the knowledge economy. this paper investigates the impact of foreign direct investment (fdi) on the development of regional innovation capabilities using a panel data set from china. it finds that fdi has a significant positive impact on the overall regional innovation capacity. fdi intensity is also positively associated with innovation efficiency in the host region. the strength of this positive effect depends, however, on the availability of the absorptive capacity and the presence of innovation-complementary assets in the host region. the increased regional innovation and technological capabilities have contributed further to regional economic growth in china's coastal regions but not in the inland regions. it concludes that the type and quality of fdi inflows and the strength of local absorptive capacity and complementary assets in the host regions are crucial for fdi to serve as a driver of knowledge-based development. policy implications are discussed.\",\"mapping product and service innovation: a bibliometric analysis and a typology. research conducted in the innovation field lags behind organizations\\u2019 general technological development and innovativeness. literature that previously depicted innovation types in developed markets is markedly different from progressively publicized emerging market innovation types. while capital-abundant firms tend to engage in respective pioneering and incremental innovation loops, resource-constrained firms and firms in emerging countries may partially free-ride on existing products and services through innovations such as copycat and frugal. to date, there have been no attempts to holistically consolidate product and service innovation types into one overarching typology. using novel methods of text mining and co-citation analysis, this study systematically maps three decades of product and service innovation scholarship to provide a typology of eight major product and service innovation types. this is further supported by case study analysis to demonstrate how these innovation types fit into the cost vs market novelty matrix. this study is unique in its methodological proposition to systematically review the innovation scholarship of more than 1,400 articles through comprehensive, quantified, and objective methods that offer transparent and reproducible results. the study provides some clarity regarding the classifications and characteristics of the innovation typology.\",\"role of big data management in enhancing big data decision-making capability and quality among chinese firms: a dynamic capabilities view. this study examines the antecedents and influence of big data decision-making capabilities on decision-making quality among chinese firms. we propose that such capabilities are influenced by big data management challenges such as leadership, talent management, technology, and organisational culture. by using primary data from 108 chinese firms and utilising partial least squares, we tested the antecedents of big data decision-making capability and its impact on decision-making quality. findings suggest that big data management challenges are the key antecedents of big data decision-making capability. furthermore, the latter is vital for big data decision-making quality.\",\"the digitalization of the innovation process: challenges and opportunities from a management perspective. purpose: as various scholars have pointed out, the exponential growth in digital technologies has resulted in significant improvements to many business processes, and has also played a significant role in the field of innovation. the purpose of this paper is to organise the contributions of this special issue according to a framework that considers three topics currently being debated extensively in literature: innovation inputs, innovation processes and innovation outcomes. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: papers in this special issue adopt both qualitative and quantitative approaches based on the purpose of the study, which gives also a methodological variety to the special issue. findings: papers in this special issue show that because of digital technologies: first, inputs are progressively becoming interrelated, making most of innovation endeavours happening in inter-organizational ecosystems of actors; second, innovation processes are gradually being compressed, anticipating and enhancing the phases in which customer feedback is gathered and employed; and finally, innovation outputs are increasingly taking the form of platforms used to create value by matching the supply of an asset with demand. originality\\u002fvalue: the value of this and other papers included in the special issue consists of embracing the topic of digital innovation from a managerial standpoint, contributing to the understanding of how the innovation process and other business processes may be affected by the use of digital technologies.\",\"the value of big data in servitization. abstract servitization has become a pervasive business strategy among manufacturers, enabling them to undergird their competitive advantage. however, it has at least one weakness. while it is used worldwide also in economies with lower production costs, services in manufacturing are slowly becoming commoditized and will become a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for reaching an above average competitive advantage. consequently, in this article we propose a new basis for competitive advantage for manufacturing enterprises called a big data strategy in servitization. we scrutinize how manufacturers can exploit the opportunity arising from combined big data and servitization. therefore, the concept of a big data strategy framework in servitization is proposed. the findings are benchmarked against established frameworks in the big data and servitization literature. its impact on competitive advantage is assessed through three theoretical perspectives that increase the validity of the results. the main finding is that, through the proposed strategy, new revenue streams can be created, while opening the possibility to decrease prices for product-services. through the proposed strategy manufacturers can differentiate themselves from the ones that are already servitizing. this article introduces the possibility of influencing the most important of the five \\\"vs\\\" in big data-value, in addition to the other four \\\"vs\\\" - volume, variety, velocity and verification. as in regards to servitization, the article adds a third layer of added value - \\\"information\\\", beside the two existing ones: product and service. the results have strategic implications for managers.\",\"thirty-fifth anniversary of the international journal of hospitality management: a bibliometric overview. international journal of hospitality management is a leading journal in \\u2018hospitality, tourism and management\\u2019 field. the journal celebrated its 35th anniversary in 2016. the aim of this paper is to provide a complete lifetime overview of the academic structure of the journal using bibliometric indicators since its inception and until the last year completed. this analysis includes key factors such as the most cited articles, leading authors, originating institutions and countries, the publication and citation structures, and the keywords most commonly used. the bibliometric data used to conduct this analysis come from the scopus database. additionally, the vos viewer software is used to create a graphic map of the bibliometric results. the graphical analysis uses co-citation, bibliographic coupling and co-occurrence. results indicate that ijhm is a leading journal in the areas where it is indexed, with publications from a wide range of authors, institutions, and countries around the world.\",\"resource management in big data initiatives: processes and dynamic capabilities. effective management of organizational resources in big data initiatives is of growing importance. although academic and popular literatures contain many examples of big data initiatives, very few are repeated in the same organization. this suggests either big data delivers benefits once only per organization or senior managers are reluctant to commit resources to big data on a sustained basis. this paper makes three contributions to the special issue's theme of enhancing organizational resource management. one is to establish an archetype business process for big data initiatives. the second contribution directs attention to creating a dynamic capability with big data initiatives. the third identifies drawbacks of resource based theory (rbt) and it's underpinning assumptions in the context of big data. the paper discusses lessons learnt and draws out implications for practice and business research. the paper's intellectual and practical contributions are based on an in-depth case study of the european ict poles of excellence (eipe) big data initiative and evidence from the extant literature.\",\"building digitally-enabled process innovation in the process industries: a dynamic capabilities approach. digitalization and industry 4.0 technologies promise to provide many novel opportunities and benefits to industrial firms, such as increased product quality, process reliability, and improved flexibility and productivity. although digitalization shows great potential from a technological perspective, many process industry firms still face challenges in utilizing it for process innovations. hence, this study aims to understand how process industry firms develop and implement new process innovations today and identify improvement opportunities through the better adoption and implementation of digitalization. the study adopted a multiple case study design in two steel manufacturing firms and developed a framework for building digitally-enabled process innovation using dynamic capabilities. the framework consists of 19 dynamic capabilities in total: 8 related to traditional process innovation and 11 related to digitally enabled process innovation. the study found four key challenges in process innovation (i.e., poor data strategy and readiness, lack of standardisation practices for change, competence and culture gaps, and ad-hoc problem solving) and four key enablers for digitally-enabled process innovation (i.e., infrastructure and methodological definition, preparation for predictive and analytical readiness, proactive management practices, and plan for a digital matureness for each function and department). the study's detailed empirical insights provide new understandings regarding required dynamic capabilities for the smoother transformation of a firm from the traditional process innovation to the digitally enabled process innovation. the dynamic capabilities are limitedly explored in the research of the process industries in the context of process innovation and digitalization. thus, this study makes essential contributions to the theory of process innovation in process industries and strategic management by providing rich empirical insights from the steel sector.\",\"data science for entrepreneurship research: studying demand dynamics for entrepreneurial skills in the netherlands. the recent rise of big data and artificial intelligence (ai) is changing markets, politics, organizations, and societies. it also affects the domain of research. supported by new statistical methods that rely on computational power and computer science\\u2014data science methods\\u2014we are now able to analyze data sets that can be huge, multidimensional, and unstructured and are diversely sourced. in this paper, we describe the most prominent data science methods suitable for entrepreneurship research and provide links to literature and internet resources for self-starters. we survey how data science methods have been applied in the entrepreneurship research literature. as a showcase of data science techniques, based on a dataset of 95% of all job vacancies in the netherlands over a 6-year period with 7.7 million data points, we provide an original analysis of the demand dynamics for entrepreneurial skills in the netherlands. we show which entrepreneurial skills are particularly important for which type of profession. moreover, we find that demand for both entrepreneurial and digital skills has increased for managerial positions, but not for others. we also find that entrepreneurial skills were significantly more demanded than digital skills over the entire period 2012\\u20132017 and that the absolute importance of entrepreneurial skills has even increased more than digital skills for managers, despite the impact of datafication on the labor market. we conclude that further studies of entrepreneurial skills in the general population\\u2014outside the domain of entrepreneurs\\u2014is a rewarding subject for future research.\",\"examining the interplay between big data analytics and contextual factors in driving process innovation capabilities. the potential of big data analytics in enabling improvements in business processes has urged researchers and practitioners to understand if, and under what combination of conditions, such novel technologies can support the enactment and management of business processes. while there is much discussion around how big data analytics can impact a firm\\u2019s incremental and radical process innovation capabilities, we still know very little about what big data analytics resources firms must invest in to drive such outcomes. to explore this topic, we ground this study on a theory-driven conceptualisation of big data analytics based on the resource-based view (rbv) of the firm. based on this conceptualisation, we examine the fit between the big data analytics resources that underpin the notion, and their interplay with organisational contextual factors in driving a firm\\u2019s incremental and radical process innovation capabilities. survey data from 202 chief information officers and it managers working in norwegian firms are analysed by means of fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsqca). results show that under different combinations of contextual factors the significance of big data analytics resources varies, with specific configurations leading to high levels of incremental and radical process innovation capabilities.\",\"the relevance of mixed methods for network analysis in tourism and hospitality research. purpose: taking stock of extant hospitality and tourism research using social network analysis approaches, this study highlights why using either quantitative or qualitative approaches to examine social networks can be misleading and generate potentially biased findings. indeed, purely qualitative and purely quantitative studies display limitations. the purpose of this study is to provide methodological insights by suggesting that mixed methods can be suitably used, depending on the specific research questions. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the study consists of an analysis and critical discussion of the methods used in a number of papers leveraging social network approaches to study social networks in tourism and hospitality. the authors describe the benefits and limitations of each method studies considered are examined based on a number of aspects. findings: more than half of the studies classified as network studies adopt quantitative designs and quantitative methods including statistical analyses and observational data. mixed methods study is a minority and they are almost never labeled as mixed methods. a relevant portion of qualitative studies increasingly embeds a number of rudimentary statistical analyses. with an example, the authors also discuss that purely quantitative or purely qualitative methods can lead to discrepant results, and thus, the authors encourage scholars to embrace mixed method research designs such as explanatory or exploratory sequential designs. advanced researchers might attempt in the future to embrace transformative, embedded or multiphase mixed methods. research limitations\\u002fimplications: this study is based on academic papers and research published before 2019. a rich research agenda is designed. originality\\u002fvalue: this study contributes to explore the way social networks have been dealt with in tourism and hospitality research so far, by advancing a proposal to adopt mixed methods in the form of explanatory or exploratory sequential designs. to the best of the knowledge, it is the first study addressing methodological pitfalls in extant network-based research within the tourism and hospitality domain.\",\"the integration between knowledge management and dynamic capabilities in agile organizations. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to describe and analyze how the integration between knowledge management and dynamic capabilities in contexts that demand organizational agility contributes to the management by objectives. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: to achieve the proposed objective, the present paper adopts the single case study in the startup effecti. for data collection, semi-structured interviews were carried out, analyzed a posteriori through the technique of content analysis. from the loads of evidence observed, a model was presented that consists of different management theories and that guides the management by objectives process of a startup. findings: the proposed model proves to be able to describe the modus operandi of a startup and enables it to develop the cycles of testing, measurement and seizure of knowledge, largely stimulated and inherent to the creation process of new businesses in dynamic and uncertain contexts. practical implications: it is expected that the research results presented in details can illustrate concrete examples of application of the main concepts: agile organization, dynamic capabilities, knowledge management, performance assessment, enterprise risk management and management by objectives. originality\\u002fvalue: the originality of this study is focused on the integration of conceptual triad and its application in the case study of a startup: agile organization, dynamic capabilities and knowledge management.\",\"broadening the scope of open innovation: past research, current state and future directions. in this first paper of the special issue, we identify some trends in open innovation research by analysing how the literature on this topics has evolved since the introduction of the concept in 2003. research on open innovation has been mushrooming ever since and the scope has been broadened in different directions. researchers also started to analyse open innovation at different level of analysis from the individual actors in organisations to ecosystems and national innovation systems. despite the vast growth in research on open innovation, we identified several directions for further research: open innovation research should be linked to other management areas such as marketing, hrm, change management, etc. in addition, our understanding of open innovation could be improved if the recently developed insights could be related to the existing management theories. copyright\",\"diffusion and assimilation of government microblogging: evidence from chinese cities. internationally, the public sector is adopting social media applications (e.g. twitter and social networking services (sns)) to harness cutting-edge information technology (it) developments, but we know little about what drives the diffusion of these applications. in this paper, i adapt the berry-berry policy and innovation diffusion model to explain the diffusion and assimilation of government microblogging, supplementing its four dimensions (learning, competition, upper-tier mandate and public pressure) with organizational resources and capacity. data on 282 prefecture-level cities in china are employed to test several theoretical hypotheses empirically. horizontal competition is found to be significantly and positively associated with the assimilation of government microblogging, although the other three dimensions are found not to be its key antecedents. consistent with the study's hypotheses, the results support the significantly positive effects of fiscal resources and it capacity. municipal wealth, size and administrative ranking are also positively and significantly correlated with the number of government microblogs.\",\"triggering disruptive technology absorptive capacity by cios. explorative research on a micro-foundation lens. the pervasive dissemination of disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligences (ai) is rapidly changing the way small to medium-sized enterprises (smes) are evolving and becoming more innovative. individual technology absorptive capacity (tac) is triggering the use of such technologies in a more effective, efficient, and easy mode by chief information officers (cios). the cio, albeit involved in the firm's micro level, encourages firms\\u2019 tac at meso level. although the cio encourages the use of disruptive technologies, studies on this field are still scarce. this research bridges the gap in the literature, offering an empirical analysis of a large-scale sample of 754 cios from knowledge-intensive smes to evaluate tac under a micro-foundation lens. the analysis provides detailed stimuli in rethinking the enhancement of cios, emphasizing the effect of the micro level in intercepting disruptive technologies, and optimizing investments in research and development in smes. the paper is part of a research line that highlights the relevant role of cios and the ability of firms\\u2019 tac in industry 4.0 at micro and meso levels. the study contributes to expanding solutions in the leveraging of disruptive technologies in the digital transformation era.\",\"how to conduct a bibliometric analysis: an overview and guidelines. bibliometric analysis is a popular and rigorous method for exploring and analyzing large volumes of scientific data. it enables us to unpack the evolutionary nuances of a specific field, while shedding light on the emerging areas in that field. yet, its application in business research is relatively new, and in many instances, underdeveloped. accordingly, we endeavor to present an overview of the bibliometric methodology, with a particular focus on its different techniques, while offering step-by-step guidelines that can be relied upon to rigorously perform bibliometric analysis with confidence. to this end, we also shed light on when and how bibliometric analysis should be used vis-\\u00e0-vis other similar techniques such as meta-analysis and systematic literature reviews. as a whole, this paper should be a useful resource for gaining insights on the available techniques and procedures for carrying out studies using bibliometric analysis.\",\"moving a mountain with a teaspoon: toward a theory of digital entrepreneurship in the regulatory environment. digital entrepreneurship is an emerging phenomenon in the digital era. while the literature has started to look into this phenomenon, the attention has been paid mainly to digital startups in free markets. in a regulatory environment, however, it is unclear how a new startup might digitally transform business through entrepreneurial actions to overcome the challenges and barriers from regulations. drawing on the dynamic capabilities and digital innovation literature, i conduct an in-depth longitudinal study at a dutch digital startup. i trace the underlying mechanisms through which it creates digital solutions to the regulations in the dutch healthcare sector \\u2014 demand-driven digital disruption, fast digital adaptation, and continuous digital transplantation. novel implications for digital entrepreneurship in the regulatory environment are presented.\",\"digital transformation and customer value creation in made in italy smes: a dynamic capabilities perspective. this study examines the impact of digital transformation on customer value creation in the context of small and medium-sized firms (smes) operating in the made in italy sectors, with the aim of understanding how dynamic capabilities, as enabling mechanisms, may foster digital transformation. we use multi-case study research on the digital transformation of six made in italy smes, belonging to the food, fashion, and furniture design industries. the results show that, for the selected smes, digital instruments contribute to innovation of their business model, creating new distribution channels and new ways to create and deliver value to customer segments. the results highlight the relevance of sensing and learning capabilities as triggers of digital transformation. in addition to the theoretical contribution to the existing literature on digital transformation and organizational capability, this study provides some managerial implications for digital transformation in smes operating in the made in italy sectors.\",\"technological innovation and circular economy practices: business strategies to mitigate the effects of covid-19. the corona virus disease 2019 (covid-19) has been a tough test on companies in the global food sector supply chain, exacerbating the realities and deficiencies it presents in developing economies. this situation has been reflected in the firm\\u2019s performance (f.p.) due to the lack of business conditions to respond to the current pandemic. however, in some companies, the adverse effects of covid-19 have been counteracted due to endowment and technological capabilities. thus, this study examined the role of technological innovation (t.i.) and business data analytics (b.d.a.) in the f.p. of foods in ecuador during covid-19. a questionnaire collected the information from the food firms. then, covariance-based structural equation modeling processed the collected in-formation. we found that (b.d.a.) mechanisms and different levels of t.i. within the developing market significantly shape the f.p. the results showed that the b.d.a. enables circular economy (c.e.) practices and the improvement of product delivery services, which constitutes an improvement of the f.p. the covid-19 outbreak did not significantly affect t.i., unlike what happened with b.d.a. this study concluded that firms with the most extraordinary technological production processes have been the least affected during covid-19. this study suggested that policy measures should boost food firms\\u2019 technological endowment to improve their resilience in uncertainty and risk scenarios.\",\"integrating bibliometrics and roadmapping methods: a case of dye-sensitized solar cell technology-based industry in china. emerging industries are attracting increasing attention as they engage in innovation activities that transgress the boundaries of science and technology. policy makers and industrial communities use roadmapping methods to predict future industrial growth, but the existing bibliometric\\u002fworkshop methods have limitations when analyzing the full-lifecycle industrial emergence, including the transitions between science, technology, application, and the mass market. this paper, therefore, proposes a framework that integrates bibliometrics and a technology roadmapping (trm) workshop approach to strategize and plan the future development of the new, technology-based industry. the dye-sensitized solar cell technology-based industry in china is selected as a case study. in this case, the bibliometrics method is applied to analyze the existing position of science and technology, and trm workshops are used to strategize the future development from technology to application and marketing. key events and impact on the development of the new, technology-based industry have been identified. this paper will contribute to the roadmapping and foresight methodology, and will be of interest to solar photovoltaic industry researchers.\",\"digital transformation as an interaction-driven perspective between business, society, and technology. digital transformation, a term introduced to talk about the various changes in business and society due to the increased usage of digital technologies, has recently gained much attention both in research and in practice. however, an analysis of 41 digital transformation frameworks following a developmental literature review shows that several areas can be expanded upon. we propose a novel framework that deals with the underrepresented areas by consolidating the various concepts found in the literature, explicitly including the role of society, highlighting the evolution over time, and including the drivers of digital transformation that we classified into 23 \\u2018digital transformation interactions\\u2019 across six categories. this novel perspective contributes to our macro-understanding of digital transformation and can be used as a lens for further research to generate fresh insights into unanswered research avenues. ultimately, this paper can be the first step towards a unified understanding of digital transformation.\",\"big data analytics (bda) and degree of internationalization: the interplay between governance of bda infrastructure and bda capabilities. in order to face the challenges of internationalization and to cope more efficiently with the uncertainty of foreign expansion, firms are called to analyze an increasing amount of real-time semi-structured and unstructured datasets. in this sense, big data analytics (bda) can become strategic in stimulating the international growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (smes). however, the specific relationship between bda and internationalization has been analyzed fragmentarily within the mainstream literature. with the purpose of shedding light on this relationship, the authors drew on resource-based view (rbv) and collected data through a questionnaire directed to ceos of 266 smes, receiving 103 responses. a quantitative analysis based on an ordinary least squares (ols) regression showed that the relationship between governance of bda infrastructure and the degree of internationalization (doi) is not significant, while the direct effect of bda capabilities as well as the interaction term between bda infrastructure and bda capabilities are positive and significant. this suggests that the governance of bda per se is not enough for enhancing internationalization in smes. on the contrary, this article points out the relevance of developing specific bda capabilities and the existence of a positive interplay between governance of bda infrastructure and bda capabilities that can exploit the new knowledge coming from bda in sme international growth.\",\"learning in strategic technology alliances. in this paper we examine the influence of strategic technology alliances on organisational learning. from an empirical perspective we examine the pre- and post-alliance knowledge bases of allying firms. we find that the pre-alliance knowledge base overlap of the allying firms has an inverted u-shaped relationship with the degree of learning taking place in the alliance. alliances established for the purpose of learning also show a significantly greater increase in knowledge base overlap for the allying firms than for non-learning alliance or non-allying firms. this shows the particular importance of learning alliances as a vehicle for organisational learning and competence development. contrary to what we expected we found that weak ties are more important than strong ties in organisational learning within strategic alliances.\",\"big data, knowledge co-creation and decision making in fashion industry. big data has become a buzzword and has been one of the most sought after topics for research. the applications of big data have been studied in various important contexts. however, very little has been explored in the realm of integrating knowledge co-creation with the usage of big data when it comes to evidence-based decision-making. the current study empirically investigates data from four fashion retailing organizations. evidence from our findings suggests that knowledge-based interactions between the customers and the salesforce in those organizations form the core of knowledge co-creation. the findings have revealed that big data indeed can assist in knowledge co-creation, which can in turn adequately lead to evidence-based, effective and efficient decision making for better business returns.\",\"digital academic entrepreneurship: a structured literature review and avenue for a research agenda. this paper reviews the academic entrepreneurship literature according to the emergence of powerful digital technologies, providing an overview of the state of research and outlining a future research agenda about digital academic entrepreneurship. one hundred and sixty-five journal papers were initially extracted from scopus and their content was analysed for the paper selection process by two researchers in parallel, plus a third one in case of uncertainty. finally, fifty-nine papers dealing with digital academic entrepreneurship and published in a variety of academic journals have been analyzed through a content and a bibliometric analysis. findings show that literature on digital academic entrepreneurship is really scant and dominated by unrelated research. content analysis provides the emergence of four major research streams: 1) digital technologies for entrepreneurship education; 2) the \\u201cmaker space movement\\u201d for academic entrepreneurship; 3) digital technologies for discovering entrepreneurial opportunities; 4) creating entrepreneurial competences in the digital \\u201cuniversity-based\\u201d entrepreneurial ecosystems. the paper presents the first attempt to provide a comprehensive structured literature review of the disruptive role of digital transformation for the academic entrepreneurship. despite the growing literature on digital entrepreneurship, this research area is still fragmented and undertheorized. more systematic and holistic studies, considering both the technological, economic and the social aspects of academic entrepreneurship are required.\",\"commercializing generic technology: the case of advanced materials ventures. generic, radical technology is of interest because of its potential for value creation across a broad range of industries and applications. advanced materials ventures are attracted by this opportunity yet face distinctive challenges in commercializing such technology. we explore an anomaly in common assumptions about the commercialization of generic technology. we build on freeman's concept of technological innovation as a technological and market matching process, on existing literature and on prior experience to build, inductively, a model of the variables influencing value creation by advanced materials ventures. we then test the model on the basis of detailed observation and analysis of two case studies, which have successfully created value through commercialization of advanced materials technology. extending this theory, we offer managerial and policy recommendations to support value creation by advanced materials ventures.\",\"how technology is changing retail. retailing is undergoing a remarkable transformation brought by recent advances in technology. in this paper, we provide a deep discussion of and look ahead on how technology is changing retail, starting with a classification of technologies that impact retailing, in particular, in the covid-19 and beyond world. we discuss different theoretical frameworks or lenses to better understand the role of technology in retailing. we identify and elaborate on the drivers and outcomes of technology adoption by shoppers, retailers, employees, and suppliers. we speculate on future retail scenarios and outline future research avenues on technology and retailing. we close by concluding that technology is not only reshaping retailing, but also allowing retailing to pivot in the face of new and unforeseen circumstances.\",\"big data analytics in turbulent contexts: towards organizational change for enhanced agility. this conceptual paper addresses the capabilities offered by big data analytics (bda), critical in turbulent environments, in the context of the industry 4.0 revolution. bda enhances organizational agility, as it is highly valuable for the identification of opportunities and threats (i.e. the sensing process of agility); however, with the exception of aiding decision-making tools, seizing its benefits for reacting (i.e. responding) is more difficult without organizational adaptation. hence, the changes required to exploit the full capabilities offered by bda, particularly at the organizational level, are considerable. from a theoretical perspective, through a narrative literature review, this paper highlights several possibilities of organizational changes for enhancing a company\\u2019s agility and leveraging bda to achieve enhanced performance in turbulent contexts. the findings are then related to three organizational theories. this work ends in a conceptual model and several research paths for future studies. from a managerial perspective, this paper highlights, through several examples, the importance of top management\\u2019s role in achieving the necessary organizational changes to enhance the companies\\u2019 responding capabilities.\",\"a resource-based view of competitive advantage at the port of singapore. the purpose of this paper is to discuss the resources, including operations and information technology that have contributed to the competitive position of the port of singapore. we present a detailed discussion of the port and its resources, and analyze the case using the resource-based view of strategy. a firm with a competitive advantage excels in time, quality, or cost, or a combination of such over its competitors. we argue that a combination of resources including supportive government policies, ample investment, and well thought out operations and information technology along with location and a natural deep harbor to help create a sustainable advantage for the port. we find that singapore compensated for some of its natural disadvantages like small land area by successfully applying information technology in critical areas to increase the island's capacity to handle shipping.\",\"digital strategy implementation: the role of individual entrepreneurial orientation and relational capital. in transformational strategy contexts such as digitalization, the entrepreneurial behavior of the firm's employees is crucial. this study examines the role of employees\\u2019 individual-level entrepreneurial orientation (ieo) in terms of proactiveness, risk-taking, and innovativeness, and their relational capital within the organization, on their performance in achieving organizations\\u2019 digital strategy goals. we hypothesize that all ieo dimensions are positively associated with employees\\u2019 digital strategy performance and that relational capital positively moderates the effect of proactiveness and risk-taking but negatively moderates the effect of innovativeness. the results of an intra-organizational survey of 166 employees at a medium-sized northern european manufacturing firm provide partial support for our hypotheses. as part of the empirical design, we introduce a four-dimensional scale for organizational and individual digital strategy performance (digital \\u2013 management, infrastructure, networking, and development \\u2013 mind). with this scale, we contrast the informants\\u2019 self-assessment of their individual performance against their assessment of the overall organizational performance. our study is one of the first to investigate ieo in a digital strategy context and provides implications for harnessing employees' entrepreneurial and innovative potential in digital transformation.\",\"extending open innovation throughout the value chain by small and medium-sized manufacturers. this study assesses the adoption of open innovation practices during different value chain activities and measures its effect on product and process innovation. based on a quantitative survey of 293 us small and medium-sized manufacturing companies the empirical research results suggest a broad use of open innovation practices with customers and suppliers throughout the firm's value chain. strong interrelationships between open innovation practices along with the varied impact of open innovation practices on product and process innovation performance are presented and discussed. overall, the study expands the understanding of open innovation beyond its traditional research and development focus, and highlights the importance of a stronger focus on selection of practices and partners for the effectiveness of open innovation.\",\"unveiling the impact of the adoption of digital technologies on firms\\u2019 innovation performance. this study aimed to understand whether the increased use of digital technologies improves innovation performance of firms. previous studies reveal that the more the firms use digital technologies, the more they can be potentially innovative. however, this is a myth. in fact, one of the main limitations of such studies is their undifferentiated approach toward the vast ocean of digital technologies. yet, given the increasing pervasiveness of digital technologies at all levels, business and society, a question emerges: how they impact the capability of firms to be innovative? counter-intuitively, we argue that most frequently used digital technologies have very low impact on innovation performance of firms as innovation is the result of creativity and of constant r&d efforts. by contrast, excess use of digital technologies may even deplete the long-run innovation capability of firms, for instance, by impoverishing the relational capital. we performed two different statistical analysis to understand whether this intuition was grounded and hypotheses would be confirmed. first, we used a principal component analysis to identify the digital technologies that are salient for innovation performance. second, we conducted a multivariate analysis of variance to understand if the identified technologies predicted innovation performance. all tests were conducted on a large-scale sample of firms operating the european union. the findings confirmed that digital technologies have very low impact on innovation performance, whilst r&d expenses are the most reliable predictor of innovation. these results challenge the false belief that digital technologies improve innovation performance. at a practical level, the results suggest that decision makers should debias themselves from considering digital technologies as the ultimate ingredient for a successful innovative firm, as this may backfire eventually.\",\"building dynamic service analytics capabilities for the digital marketplace. service firms are now interacting with customers through a multitude of channels or touchpoints. this progression into the digital realm is leading to an explosion of data, and warranting advanced analytic methods to manage service systems. known as big data analytics, these methods harness insights to deliver, serve, and enhance the customer experience in the digital marketplace. although global economies are becoming service-oriented, little attention is paid to the role of analytics in service systems. as such, drawing on a systematic literature review and thematic analysis of 30 in-depth interviews, this study aims to understand the nature of service analytics to identify its capability dimensions. integrating the diverse areas of research on service systems, big data and dynamic capability theories, we propose a dynamic service analytics capabilities (dsac) framework consisting of management, technology, talent, data governance, model development, and service innovation capability. we also propose a future research agenda to advance dsac research for the emerging service systems in the digital marketplace.\",\"science, technology and innovation ecosystem transformation toward society 5.0. society 5.0 is the vision of a new human-centered society in the fifth stage launched by japan. this paper explores a prospective model of science, technology and innovation (sti) activities in society 5.0 from an ecosystem perspective. sti policy review and statistical analysis are conducted in comparison with germany and the united states to describe the historical transformation of japan's sti ecosystem. major socio-economic risks on japan's sti ecosystem can be classified as labor, capital and spatial risks. shifting from a push-based sti ecosystem to a pull-based sti ecosystem and increasing the system resilience through value creation for society are essential to reduce three risks and to revitalize productivity and growth in society 5.0.\",\"green innovation as a mediator in the impact of business analytics and environmental orientation on green competitive advantage. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of business analytics and environmental orientation toward green innovation and green competitive advantage. in addition, the study aims to explore the mediating role of green innovation in the impact of business analytics and environmental orientation on green competitive advantage. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: based upon the theoretical analysis of existing literature, several hypotheses have been developed. data was gathered using a survey method. the survey was conducted using online portal, 388 valid responses have been processed using spss 23.0 and amos 23.0 for empirical analysis. two steps were used, first reliability and validity have been measured. following this, the authors employed structural equation modeling technique to test hypothetical relationships. findings: the results from the authors\\u2019 empirical analysis indicate that business analytics and environmental orientation have a pivotal role toward green innovation as well as green competitive advantage. if the results are seen comparatively, then it can be indicated that the role of business analytics is more powerful compared with the environmental orientation. although environmental orientation is a key factor of green innovation, but its direct role toward green competitive advantage is not so strong. similarly, to check the other mechanisms, the role of green innovation as a mediator was explored. empirical findings have established the mediating role of green innovation in the influence of business analytics and environmental orientation on green competitive advantage. thus, the results confirm a mechanism of green innovation in the impact of business analytics and environmental orientation on green competitive advantage. practical implications: the study captures the attention of decision-makers and highlights that business leaders need to emphasize on business analytics while making managerial decisions related to green innovation and green competitive advantage. originality\\u002fvalue: for the first time, this study explored the role of business analytics and environmental orientation together toward green innovation and green competitive advantage. the study adds value to the existing literature and opens new avenues for scholarly research in the area of managerial decision-making.\",\"digitalization and its influence on business model innovation. purpose: increased digitalization has influenced various business activities including companies\\u2019 business models (bms) by enabling various new forms of cooperation between companies and leading to new product and service offerings as well as new forms of company relationships with customers and employees. at the same time, this digitalization has put pressure on companies to reflect on their current strategy and explore new business opportunities systematically and at early stages. while research on digitalization in the context of bms is now gaining increased attention, a research gap still exists in this field since the number of empirical insights is limited. the paper aims to discuss these issues. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: qualitative empirical data collected from 12 key informants working in two distinctive industries, the media and automotive industries, were collected. an investigation was carried out to examine the differences and similarities among how digitalization influences a company\\u2019s value creation, proposition and capture, as well as how firms cope with challenges presented by increased digitalization. findings: the findings of the study show that, whilst digitalization is generally considered to be important, the value proposition itself as also the position in the value network determine the perceived available options for business model innovation (bmi) by digitalization. moreover, the organizational capacities and employee competences were identified as future challenges that will be faced by both industries. originality\\u002fvalue: the findings of this study have revealed that representatives of the media and automotive industries perceive both the pressures and opportunities of digitalization regarding bmi; its application and exploitation, however, remain challenging. this study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing empirical insights in the context of digitalization and bmi.\",\"industry 4.0 innovation ecosystems: an evolutionary perspective on value cocreation. industry 4.0 considers complex interrelated iot-based technologies for the provision of digital solutions. such a complexity demands a vast set of capabilities that are hard to be found in a single technology provider, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (smes). innovation ecosystems allow smes to integrate resources and cocreate industry 4.0 solutions. we aim to understand how such ecosystems can consolidate and evolve, and how value is cocreated within them. we adopt a social exchange perspective to consider the relationships in the ecosystem across six structural dimensions and three lifecycle stages. we analyze eleven years of an ecosystem's evolution using a technology mapping of 87 companies, 37 interviews with stakeholders, and a 2.5-year follow-up of a testbed project conducted by 8 companies. our final framework shows that the ecosystem's mission shifted from accessing innovation funds to industry 4.0 solution cocreation and, then, to smart business solutions cocreation. as trust and commitment grew, the power structure shifted from the centrality of business association toward a mechanism of neutral coordination of complex projects involving the university and business associations and, lastly, to a platform-driven ecosystem structure, where key technologies emerged as drivers of relationships among the companies and value cocreation. we also show the changes of reciprocity between actors, as well as in value exchange and expected rewards from the social exchange. managers can learn how to establish technology development strategies in industry 4.0 ecosystems, while policymakers can learn how to organize the evolution of such ecosystems.\",\"a three decade mixed-method bibliometric investigation of the ieee transactions on engineering management. this paper offers a comprehensive overview of the ieee transactions on engineering management (ieee tem) from 1985 to 2017. this paper employs a mixed-method examination based on an in-depth interview with the new editor-in-chief regarding the challenges for the future of ieee tem, along with a bibliometric analysis of the journal. by using web of science core collection data, the analysis maps the knowledge produced and disseminated by ieee tem, revealing the most cited papers, the most frequently occurring keywords and the interconnection between them, the most prolific authors and their coauthorship network, and the most prolific countries for published articles. this paper also shows the main avenues of research covered by ieee tem and their

including other sources of data.\",\"from ai to digital transformation: the ai readiness framework. strategies and means for selecting and implementing digital technologies that realize firms\\u2019 goals in digital transformation have been extensively investigated. the recent surge in artificial intelligence (ai) technologies has amplified the need for such investigation, as they are being increasingly used in diverse organizational practices, creating not only new opportunities for digital transformation but also new challenges for managers of digital transformation processes. in this article, i present a framework intended to assist efforts to address one of the first of these challenges: assessment of organizational ai readiness\\u2014that is, an organization's ability to deploy ai technologies to enable digital transformation, in four key dimensions: technologies, activities, boundaries, and goals. i show that this framework can facilitate analysis both of an organization's current sociotechnical ai status and of the prospects for the technology's fuller value-adding, sociotechnical deployment. the ai readiness framework invites fuller theorizing of the roles that ai can\\u2014and will\\u2014play in digital transformation.\",\"interrelationship between big data and knowledge management: an exploratory study in the oil and gas sector. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between big data and knowledge management (km). design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the study adopts a qualitative research methodology and a case study approach was followed by conducting nine semi-structured interviews with open-ended and probing questions. findings: useful predictive knowledge can be generated through big data to help companies improve their km capability and make effective decisions. moreover, combination of tacit knowledge of relevant staff with explicit knowledge obtained from big data improvises the decision-making ability. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the focus of the study was on oil and gas sector, and, thus, the research results may lack generalizability. originality\\u002fvalue: this paper fulfills an identified need of exploring the relationship between big data and km which has not been discussed much in the literature.\",\"big data analytics capability and market performance: the roles of disruptive business models and competitive intensity. research shows that big data analytics capability (bdac) is a major determinant of firm performance. however, scant research has theoretically articulated and empirically tested the mechanisms and conditions under which bdac influences performance. this study advances existing knowledge on the bdac\\u2013performance relationship by drawing on the knowledge-based view and contingency theory to argue that how and when bdac influences market performance is dependent on the intervening role of disruptive business models and the contingency role of competitive intensity. we empirically test this argument on primary data from 360 firms in the united kingdom. the results show that disruptive business models partially mediate the positive effect of bdac on market performance, and this indirect positive effect is strengthened when competitive intensity increases. these findings provide new perspectives on the business model processes and competitive conditions under which firms maximize marketplace value from investments in bdacs.\",\"understanding the manufacturing location decision: the case for the transaction cost and capability perspectives. this article highlights the value of employing the resource-based view (rbv) and transaction cost economics (tce) to understand the manufacturing location decision. the rbv can assist with analyzing manufacturing capabilities, which can link the decision with performance and the competitive position of the organization. tce provides a powerful theoretical lens to augment this analysis. understanding transaction costs allows an organization to adopt a relationship strategy, which reduces the risks of outsourcing while at the same time leverages the specialist capabilities of suppliers. moreover, further research is required to enhance our understanding of how the variables from the rbv and tce interact in sourcing decisions. in particular, it is argued that employing these theories in the manufacturing location decision would contribute to the academic debate on the complementary and contradictory prescriptions of tce and the rbv in outsourcing decision-making contexts.\",\"science and technology as predictors of stock performance. innovation and technological change are the main drivers of companies' productivity and growth. but public information on companies' efforts to innovate (namely, their investment in science and technology and the consequences of that investment) is generally scant and not timely. to alleviate this impediment to the valuation of companies' performance and prospects, we examined the ability of a new set of publicly available patent-related measures to reflect science- and technology-based companies' potential and growth. we tested the ability of the patent-related measures to predict stock returns and market-to-book ratios. our empirical results indicate that patent measures reflecting the volume of companies' research activity, the impact of companies' research on subsequent innovations, and the closeness of research and development to science are reliably associated with the future performance of r&d-intensive companies in capital markets.\",\"two decades of the journal of intellectual capital: a bibliometric overview and an agenda for future research. purpose: the journal of intellectual capital (jic) is one of the leading academic journals in the field of business and management, with an impact factor of 3.744, according to journal citation reports from clarivate analytics, 2019. this study reports the results of a content analysis of the jic articles that have been published since the journal was founded in 2000, in order to highlight its significant contribution and identify potential future research avenues within the business and management field. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: scopus database, complemented by the web of science (wos) core collection, was used. furthermore, this study graphically maps over 20 years' worth of bibliographic material, using the visualization of similarities (vos) to present an overview of the journal and identify future research avenues. findings: the paper provides an overview of a total of 700 articles and editorial notes, authored by leading authors from various universities, as well as collating the research themes explored during the 20 year period between 2000 and 2019. the prestigious positioning of this journal is evidenced both through the increasing number of citations received from other highly regarded journals and through its impact upon the establishment of new streams of research. practical implications: by applying a bibliometric analysis, this paper offers an overview of past and current themes on intellectual capital (ic). originality\\u002fvalue: this article delivers an in-depth and rigorous analysis of the fields and research streams interrogated by the jic over the last 20 years and offers potential topics for future research, which could stimulate authors and inspire advancements in research for years to come.\",\"the effect of ai-based crm on organization performance and competitive advantage: an empirical analysis in the b2b context. organizations have cultural-cognitive and regulative as well as normative elements that impact their employees. organizations, by definition, cannot achieve a pure, stable state and always go through various change processes, both incremental and radical changes. moving from legacy business-to-business (b2b) relationship management to an artificial intelligence-based customer relationship management (ai-crm) is a gradual but paradigm change. ai-crm leverages intelligent systems to automate the b2b relationship activities where the decision can be taken automatically without any human intervention. relationship management in the b2b segment is considered a strategic activity of an organization. moving from legacy to ai-crm to facilitate b2b relationship management activities is an important decision, and proper implementation of ai-crm is a critical success parameter for an organization. this study combines institutional theory and the resource-based view (rbv) in b2b relationship management to understand how ai-crm could impact the firm's performance with varied firm size, firm age, and industry type.\",\"monitoring the organic structure of technology based on the patent development paths. as the strategic importance of understanding changes in technology for successful business of most firms increases, the ability to analyze and monitor the current stage and history of technology is reckoned as a critical asset both for gaining competitive advantage and identifying promising niches. patent citation networks have been widely used for systematic and empirical analysis of technology development. understanding of technology's detailed changes in large patent citation networks, however, is difficult to achieve because of these networks' large and complex structures. to overcome this problem, we suggest an algorithm that identifies patent development paths from a large patent citation network by evaluating the weight of citations between patents. we then apply this algorithm to flash memory patents in an empirical study. our algorithm is a new methodology that can be used to analyze the dynamic and complex structure of individual technologies.\",\"lock-in of mature innovation systems: the transformation toward clean concrete in the netherlands. energy-intensive processing industries like the concrete industry form the base of the economy and account for a large part of global greenhouse gas emissions. sectoral transformation to cleaner basic materials is therefore crucial, and institutional pressure to do so is increasing. however, socio-technical studies have not sufficiently addressed these sectors. this paper therefore sets out to analyze the systemic problems that inhibit the transformation of the mature innovation system of the concrete sector toward the development and diffusion of clean concrete innovations, for the case of the netherlands. a structural-functional approach has been frequently applied to identify such systemic problems, but has been limited to emerging technological innovation systems. consequently, the approach tends to overlook the systemic lock-in that arises from closed cycles of interdependent systemic problems and vested interests that characterize mature innovation systems and that hamper system transformation. this paper analyzes these characteristics to extend the application of the structural-functional approach to the transformation of mature innovation systems. interviews with 28 stakeholders were conducted and triangulated with reports, websites and other documents. a list of systemic problems was identified that originate within actors, institutions, networks, technology and infrastructure and that impaired the performance of all system functions except knowledge development. systemic problems are indeed found to be sustained through systemic lock-in, i.e. closed cycles of interdependent systemic problems. through strategic, often collective action, established firms with vested interests were able to reinforce these interdependent systemic problems to inhibit clean concrete innovation. the study concludes that systemic lock-in inhibits the sustainability transformation of the mature innovation system of concrete in the netherlands and confirms that the application of the structural-functional approach can be extended from emerging to mature innovation systems. overcoming systemic lock-in requires a series of well coordinated policy measures that should be implemented in a specific order, to prevent reverting back to the lock-in around the original system configuration.\",\"scientific evolutionary pathways: identifying and visualizing relationships for scientific topics. whereas traditional science maps emphasize citation statistics and static relationships, this paper presents a term-based method to identify and visualize the evolutionary pathways of scientific topics in a series of time slices. first, we create a data preprocessing model for accurate term cleaning, consolidating, and clustering. then we construct a simulated data streaming function and introduce a learning process to train a relationship identification function to adapt to changing environments in real time, where relationships of topic evolution, fusion, death, and novelty are identified. the main result of the method is a map of scientific evolutionary pathways. the visual routines provide a way to indicate the interactions among scientific subjects and a version in a series of time slices helps further illustrate such evolutionary pathways in detail. the detailed outline offers sufficient statistical information to delve into scientific topics and routines and then helps address meaningful insights with the assistance of expert knowledge. this empirical study focuses on scientific proposals granted by the united states national science foundation, and demonstrates the feasibility and reliability. our method could be widely applied to a range of science, technology, and innovation policy research, and offer insight into the evolutionary pathways of scientific activities.\",\"a bibliometric analysis of managerial finance: a retrospective. purpose: managerial finance (mf) started publication in 1975 and celebrated its 45th anniversary in 2019. the purpose of this study is to provide a bibliometric analysis of mf between 1996 and 2019. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this study uses the scopus database to analyze the most frequent authors in mf along with their affiliated institutions and countries. it also identifies the most often cited mf articles. this study uses bibliometric indicators to analyze productivity and stature of mf. it also uses such tools as bibliographic coupling, keyword analysis and coauthorship analysis to analyze mf. further, the study provides a temporal analysis of mf publishing across different ownership periods. findings: mf publishes between 60 and 70 articles each year and its number of citations steadily grows. although contributors to the journal come from around the globe, they most often are affiliated with the united states, the united kingdom and greece. temporal analysis of journal's themes reveals that it has expanded its scope from accounting research to a much wider array of finance topics. bibliographic coupling network analysis shows that major themes published in mf involve stock markets, corporate governance, banking, financial decision-making and initial public offerings. research limitations\\u002fimplications: due to the unavailability of bibliometric data, the analysis excludes an analysis of mf between 1975 and 1995. originality\\u002fvalue: this study provides the first overview of the mf's publication and citation trends as well as its thematic structure. it also suggests future directions that the journal might take.\",\"computational news discovery: towards design considerations for editorial orientation algorithms in journalism. computational news discovery (cnd) is a particular application area within computational journalism related to the use of algorithms to orient editorial attention to potentially newsworthy events or information prior to publication. previous work in this area has been concentrated on prototyping cnd tools, which can, for instance, send alerts and leads to journalists about social media events, documents of interest, or salient patterns in streams of data. this article describes a qualitative interview study of journalists as they incorporate cnd tools into their practices. findings provide insights into how cnd tools interact with the internal attention economy and sociotechnical gatekeeping processes of the newsroom and how future cnd tools might better align with necessary journalistic evaluations of newsworthiness and quality, while ensuring configurability, human agency, and flexible applicability to a wide range of use cases. these findings begin to outline a conceptual framework that can help guide the effective design of future cnd tools.\",\"opening up the innovation process: the role of technology aggressiveness. besides acquiring external knowledge, many firms have begun to actively commercialize technology, for example, by means of out-licensing. this increase in inward and outward technology transactions reflects the new paradigm of open innovation. most prior research into open innovation is limited to theoretical considerations and case studies, whereas other lines of research have focused either on external technology acquisition or exploitation. in an integrative view, we consider inward and outward technology transactions as the main directions of open innovation. moreover, technology aggressiveness, which constitutes an important dimension of technology strategy, is identified as a major determinant of open innovation. data from a survey of 154 industrial firms are used to test three hypotheses relating technology aggressiveness, external technology acquisition, and external technology exploitation. in addition, clusters of firms with homogeneous strategies regarding technology aggressiveness and open innovation are identified.\",\"beyond the single path view: interpath dynamics in regional contexts. recurrent economic and financial crises, globalization, digitalization, and climate change are posing major challenges for regional economies to constantly renew their industrial structures. over the past few years much progress has been made in understanding how new path development unfolds in a regional context. earlier contributions to the path development literature have acknowledged that multiple industrial paths developing within a region are interdependent and coevolving. however, most conceptualizations and empirical analyses to date have mainly been focused on one new path or path development activities in one nascent industry only. potential relationships between emerging paths have received little attention, and, as a consequence, little is known about how new paths shape each other\\u2019s evolution. this article draws on recent contributions that broaden conventional perspectives on regional structural change and develops a framework to analyze the dynamic interdependencies between multiple new regional growth paths. we explore the nature of interpath linkages and discuss the role of agency in creating or shaping the relationship between linked paths to be either supportive, competitive, or neutral toward each other. by means of illustrative empirical examples, we show that interpath relationships in a regional context are a significant phenomenon to be considered in regional structural change and conclude by discussing policy implications and identifying avenues for future research.\",\"why pls-sem is suitable for complex modelling? an empirical illustration in big data analytics quality. the emergence of multivariate analysis techniques transforms empirical validation of theoretical concepts in social science and business research. in this context, structural equation modelling (sem) has emerged as a powerful tool to estimate conceptual models linking two or more latent constructs. this paper shows the suitability of the partial least squares (pls) approach to sem (pls-sem) in estimating a complex model drawing on the philosophy of verisimilitude and the methodology of soft modelling assumptions. the results confirm the utility of pls-sem as a promising tool to estimate a complex, hierarchical model in the domain of big data analytics quality.\",\"strategies for achieving success for innovative versus incremental new services. purpose the purpose of this paper is to examine whether managers should have a different approach for the development of very innovative services from that of incremental new services. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach this paper is based on a large\\ue4f8scale survey to examine hotel innovation projects to gain insight about the impact of level of innovativeness on the factors that are linked to new service success and failure. findings the research results show that there are two global success factors regardless of their degree of newness \\u2013 market attractiveness and strategic human resources management. several other factors, however, are found to influence the outcome of incremental projects, such as: service advantage, empowerment, training of employees, behavior\\ue4f8based evaluation, tangible quality and marketing synergy. for very innovative new hotel services, market responsiveness and pre\\ue4f8launch activities are found to be related to success. research limitations\\u002fimplications further research should investigate whether the results are applicable to other countries and other service segments as well as to consider a staff or customer outcome perspective. practical implications managers who design new service development processes that are tied to the key success features in innovative or incremental new service development (nsd) increases the likelihood of success. originality\\u002fvalue the differences in success factors between innovative and incremental new services has not been clearly articulated to date. innovativeness is linked to levels of risk, ambiguity, necessary resources and complexity and this paper shows that firms should have different priorities and approaches when developing new services.\",\"digitalization driven retail business model innovation: evaluation of past and avenues for future research trends. increased digitalization enabled innovation and practical examples from the retail industry have captured the attention of marketing scholars, with rapid development in the academic field. the pace of change has significantly accelerated during the covid-19 crisis. in seeking to (1) investigate the unique characteristics of digitalization enabled retail business model innovation, (2) understand how does digitalization influences changes to the retail business model innovation dimensions, and (3) identify the areas for future research related to retail business model innovation, this study systematically reviews the literature. employing four databases, a sample of 170 articles were chosen. based on bibliometric and network analysis and visualization, the major researchers, articles, and topics were rigorously identified. finally, the results revealed the unaddressed issues in this research area. the study ends with theoretical and managerial implications.\",\"the role of digital innovation in knowledge management systems: a systematic literature review. this article investigates the literary corpus on digital innovation in knowledge management systems (kms) to understand its role in business governance. the study introduces a broad survey of the scientific literature on this topic to understand how digital innovation promotes new business models through the optimization of new knowledge. we carried out a bibliometric analysis on a database, including 46 articles published in the last three decades (1990\\u20132020). all the articles were written in english. the results show that research published on the topic reveals interesting implications for business models and business performance. these findings especially highlight the links between innovation and sustainability, revealing that digital transformation tools contribute over the long-term to the value creation process. this research contributes to the existing literature analyzing the kms topic by considering it from the digital innovation processes perspective, pointing out the need to implement new knowledge creation and to share measures which support global and inclusive growth.\",\"mapping the knowledge evolution and professional network in the field of technology roadmapping: a bibliometric analysis. to maintain a competitive advantage, organisations constantly adjust their operations and strategies to incorporate changes in their business environment. technology roadmapping (trm) has emerged as a method that can link technology development with the changing business requirements. since the method of trm is fairly new, publications that can explain and assist the implementation of a roadmapping process are still limited. as the concept of trm continues to gain awareness among scholars and practitioners, the need for further development of trm related knowledge becomes a vital part of their activities. the purpose of this paper is not only to reveal the body of knowledge and existing networks of trm professionals but also to suggest potential collaborations among researchers and practitioners who have similar interests in the field. this study applies the bibliometric technique to analyse trm related journal and conference articles published during 1987 and 2010.\",\"stability in turbulent times? the effect of digitalization on the sustainability of competitive advantage. does digitalization make competitive advantage more or less sustainable? one line of argument is that digitalization leads to hyper-competition and shorter spells of competitive advantage. an opposing claim is that digitalization leads to advantages of a size and sustainability unprecedented in the \\u201cold\\u201d economy. we argue that the likelihood of observing either of these outcomes depend on the extent to which the dominant business model(s) in a market combine the accumulation and use of big data with the generation and utilization of network effects. the more complementary big data and network effects are in a business model, the more likely that we will observe large and sustainable competitive advantages, and vice-versa. furthermore, we argue that firms enjoying a data-driven network-advantage have strong incentives and ability to envelop to adjacent markets. in the longer run, such envelopment will cause an increasing number of markets to be characterized by more sustainable competitive advantages.\",\"how to design and utilize online customer center to support new product concept generation. websites can be effective vehicles for firms to communicate with their customers but the use of websites has been limited to pacifying complaint customers. to better use a website's information, this research presents a framework for extracting customer opinions from websites and transforming them into product specification data. for the purpose, firstly, customer opinions were collected from an online customer center and then transformed into customer needs using text-mining. then, after customers were segmented into several groups based on their needs, relations among their needs were visualized by co-word analysis and product specifications to meet those needs t analyzed by decision tree. lastly, a final target product specification for new products were determined and a target market was identified based on customer profile data. the suggested framework enables to incorporate customer opinions efficiently with new product development processes and to design online customer centers to better collect and analyze useful information.\",\"developing relational capabilities in hotels. purpose - the purpose of this research is to show that relational capabilities is a topic of interest for the competitiveness of hotel companies. this paper aims to present a methodology based on the analysis of processes in order to create and strengthen relational capabilities and proposes a model with three dimensions that jointly analyzes this phenomenon in relation to the outsourcing of activities and the collateral relationships maintained between different hotels. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach - creates a methodology to rethink the relationships between the hotel company, its suppliers and other hotels in the same tourist destination. the creation of relational capabilities necessarily requires the hotel to study and analyze the following stages: internal analysis of resources and capabilities; relational analysis of activities; and process integration. a model is also proposed to analyze this question. findings - the development of relational capabilities in outsourcing is based on the level of competence of the service companies and on the strategic contribution of the activities, with four cases analyzed: high competence and low strategic contribution; low competence and high strategic contribution; low competence and low strategic value; and relational and internal capabilities. the joint analysis of the outsourcing relationships and collateral relationships among hotels adds a third dimension of process integration, with four possibilities: non-core activities and low collateral processes integration; core activities and low collateral processes integration; non-core activities and high collateral process integration; and core activities and high collateral processes integration. practical implications - a short self-assessment questionnaire is developed that may help hotels to implement the methodology, as well as to create the basis for the empirical application by researchers in hospitality management. originality\\u002fvalue - the paper studies the possibilities of developing relational capabilities in the sector. it also determines the process to be followed in order to develop relational capabilities in the outsourcing of activities and in collateral relationships between hotels.\",\"topic analysis and forecasting for science, technology and innovation: methodology with a case study focusing on big data research. the number and extent of current science, technology & innovation topics are changing all the time, and their induced accumulative innovation, or even disruptive revolution, will heavily influence the whole of society in the near future. by addressing and predicting these changes, this paper proposes an analytic method to (1) cluster associated terms and phrases to constitute meaningful technological topics and their interactions, and (2) identify changing topical emphases. our results are carried forward to present mechanisms that forecast prospective developments using technology roadmapping, combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies. an empirical case study of awards data from the united states national science foundation, division of computer and communication foundation, is performed to demonstrate the proposed method. the resulting knowledge may hold interest for r&d management and science policy in practice.\",\"profiting from innovation in the digital economy: enabling technologies, standards, and licensing models in the wireless world. the value-capture problem for innovators in the digital economy involves some different challenges from those in the industrial economy. it inevitably requires understanding the dynamics of platforms and ecosystems. these challenges are amplified for enabling technologies, which are the central focus of this article. the innovator of an enabling technology has a special business model challenge because the applicability to many downstream verticals forecloses, as a practical matter, ownership of all the relevant complements. complementary assets (vertical and lateral) in the digital context are no longer just potential value-capture mechanisms (through asset price appreciation or through preventing exposure to monopolistic bottleneck pricing by others); they may well be needed simply for the technology to function. technological and innovational complementors present both coordination and market design challenges to the innovator that generally lead to market failure in the form of an excess of social over private returns. the low private return leads to socially sub-optimal underinvestment in future r&d that can be addressed to some extent by better strategic decision-making by the innovator and\\u002for by far-sighted policies from government and the judiciary. the default value-capture mechanism for many enabling technologies is the licensing of trade secrets and\\u002for patents. licensing is shown to be a difficult business model to implement from a value-capture perspective. when injunctions for intellectual property infringement are hard to win, or even to be considered, the incentives for free riding by potential licensees are considerable. licensing is further complicated if it involves standard essential patents, as both courts and policy makers may fail to understand that development of a standard involves components of both interoperability and technology development. if a technology standard is not treated as the embodiment of significant r&d efforts enabling substantial new downstream economic activity, then rewards are likely to be calibrated too low to support appropriate levels of future innovation.\",\"identifying the evolutionary process of emerging technologies: a chronological network analysis of world wide web conference sessions. the significance of a computer-based approach in roadmapping processes will increase in accordance with the ever-larger number of scientific publications and enhanced computing technologies. this article proposes a method to analyse chronological changes in research topics as observed from proceedings papers and conference sessions using a text-mining technique, which enables us to detect, identify, and analyse the evolutionary process of emerging technologies in the many rapidly growing research fields. chronological networks of conference sessions from world wide web conferences between 2002 and 2011 are used to visualize the scientific and technical streams formed by the session sequences. the chronological networks demonstrate the evolutionary process of 'social networks', 'monetization' and 'semantic analysis' studies. in the evolutionary process of emerging web-based technology, the convergent session nodes that recapitulate past research topics and the divergent session nodes in the networks play significant roles in promoting dynamic interactions among research topics. the proposed method is distinctive in that it is prospective: the session titles reflect future perspectives, including researchers' expectations for pioneering new research fields within a scientific community. this article also discusses the characteristics of a textual method for scientific publication analysis in terms from the aspect coverage, data, links and stability.\",\"a bibliometric visualization of the economics and sociology of wealth inequality: a world apart?. wealth inequality research is fragmented across different social science disciplines. this article explores the potential of interdisciplinary perspectives by investigating the thematic overlap between economic and sociological approaches to wealth inequality. to do so, we use the web of science citation database to identify pertinent articles on the topic of wealth inequality in each discipline (1990\\u20122017). on the basis of complete bibliographies of these selected articles, we construct co-citation networks and obtain thematic clusters. what becomes evident is a low thematic overlap: economists explore the causes of wealth inequality based on mathematical models and study the interplay between inequality and economic growth. sociologists focus mostly on wealth disparities between ethnic groups. the article identifies, however, a few instances of cross-disciplinary borrowing and the french economist thomas piketty as a novel advocate of interdisciplinarity in the field. the prospects of an economics-cum-sociology of wealth inequality are discussed in the conclusion.\",\"competitive tension: the awareness-motivation-capability perspective. this paper investigates competitive tension, or the strain between a focal firm and a given rival that is likely to result in the firm taking action against the rival. drawing on the awareness-motivation-capability perspective, we show how perceived competitive tension, as constructed from managers' and industry stakeholders' competitor assessments, is influenced by the independent and interactive effects of three factors: relative scale, rival's attack volume, and rival's capability to contest. our results provide a new avenue for studying competitors and the relationship between competitor analysis and interfirm rivalry.\",\"value proposition as a catalyst for a customer focused innovation. purpose: this paper seeks to advance the theory on value proposition and innovation by offering a framework for identifying value proposition elements. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a single embedded case study is conducted based on amazon.com's innovations. findings: by identifying and systematically analysing innovations by amazon.com, the concept of value proposition was decomposed into five components: performance, ease of use, reliability, flexibility and affectivity (perfa). research limitations\\u002fimplications: the research did not focus on the relationships between the value proposition elements and their relevance in different contexts such as product, industry or customer life cycle. practical implications: managers should support their decision to innovate the value proposition based on customers' perceived value. the findings provide guidance to managers on how to uncover innovative value propositions and potentially create new demand in an uncontested market space. originality\\u002fvalue: the paper is an original attempt to correlate value proposition and innovation. it provides researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the structure of a value proposition and how innovation can influence it.\",\"resources and digital export: an rbv perspective on the role of digital technologies and capabilities in cross-border e-commerce. building on the resource-based view (rbv) perspective of the firm and firms\\u2019 competitive capabilities, this study examines the digital export drivers as means for firms to exploit opportunities brought about by digital technologies in their b2c digital marketing activities. by leveraging a unique dataset covering 102 italy-based firms of different sizes (small, medium, and large), active in three different sectors (design and furniture, fashion, and food and beverage), this work examines the role of firm resources to support internationalization via digital channels. we find that: (1) smes do not suffer from a weaker propensity to engage with digital export despite resources constraints; (2) firms leveraging digital technologies are more likely to enhance their digital export, regardless of firm size; (3) digital capabilities are critical as firms employing an e-commerce manager have a higher propensity to undertake digital export than firms relying on a traditional export manager, regardless of firm size.\",\"assessing the impact of big data on firm innovation performance: big data is not always better data. in this study, we explore the impacts of big data's main characteristics (i.e., volume, variety, and velocity) on innovation performance (i.e., innovation efficacy and efficiency), which eventually impacts firm performance (i.e., customer perspective, financial returns, and operational excellence). to address this objective, we collected data from 239 managers and empirically examined the relationships in the proposed model. the results reveal that, while data variety and velocity positively enhance firm innovation performance, data volume has no significant impact. the finding that data volume does not play a critical role in enhancing firm innovation performance contributes novel insights to the literature by contradicting the prevalent belief that big data is better data. moreover, the findings reveal that data velocity plays a more important role in improving firm innovation performance than other big data characteristics.\",\"understanding the impact of big data on firm performance: the necessity of conceptually differentiating among big data characteristics. this study uses the resource-based view to explore the impact of data volume, data velocity, and data variety, which are the main characteristics of big data, on firm performance and the mediating roles of data value and data veracity on these relationships. to test the research model, we collected data from 143 top and middle level managers in the united states. the findings show that data variety positively improves data value generation, whereas data volume and data velocity do not impact it. additionally, while data volume negatively impacts data veracity, data velocity and data variety positively impact it. findings indicate the necessity of conceptually differentiating among big data characteristics in investigating their impacts on firm outcomes instead of treating big data as a holistic variable. the study provides useful insights for researchers and managers willing to better understand the role of big data characteristics in influencing firm performance.\",\"innovation, entrepreneurship and knowledge in the business scientific field: mapping the research front. innovation, entrepreneurship and knowledge have been acknowledged as the basis of economic competiveness and growth, with recent research pointing out the powerful impact of their joint consideration. specific literature has emerged in the last years suggesting that the three concepts constitute a promising new scholarly discipline. nevertheless, previous bibliometric studies have highlighted that these three research fields are still mainly developing in a separate manner. the aim of this study is to analyze the current research front at the intersection of the three concepts in business research, through a bibliometric study based on performance metrics, bibliographic coupling and word co-occurrence analysis. this study aims to provide researchers, firms, and policy-makers with a valuable source of knowledge that allows them to define research lines, business strategies and policy measures. innovation, entrepreneurship and knowledge studies in the business area configure a promising research field at an early stage of development.\",\"knowledge integration processes and dynamics within the context of cross-functional projects. this paper examines the dynamics of knowledge integration in the context of cross-functional project implementation within four large organizations. specifically, the research focuses on exploring and conceptualizing the efficiency, scope and flexibility of knowledge integration [organization science, 7(4) (1996), 375] of which limited empirical evidence has been offered. through the comparative study, the findings suggest that knowledge integration in the context of cross-functional project implementation is in essence a process of engaging organizational members through the promotion of project benefits and the management of social networks. also, our findings reveal that an organization's embedded practices, past integration experience and social capital plays a key role in shaping the level of coordination that in turn influences the efficiency and scope of integration. in particular, the development and nurturing of social capital within and beyond the project team is crucial, as is the promotion of project awareness through the creation of common knowledge.\",\"the digitalization and public crisis responses of small and medium enterprises: implications from a covid-19 survey. the covid-19 outbreak is a global crisis that has placed small and medium enterprises (smes) under huge pressure to survive, requiring them to respond effectively to the crisis. smes have adopted various digital technologies to cope with this crisis. using a data set from a survey with 518 chinese smes, the study examines the relationship between smes\\u2019 digitalization and their public crisis responses. the empirical results show that digitalization has enabled smes to respond effectively to the public crisis by making use of their dynamic capabilities. in addition, digitalization can help improve smes\\u2019 performance. we propose a theoretical framework of digitalization and crisis responses for smes and present three avenues for future research.\",\"a dynamic panel study on digitalization and firm's agility: what drives agility in advanced economies 2009\\u20132018. firm agility today is not a factor of competitiveness or success but a survival instrument on the market. disruptive innovations and technological advancement, together with digitalization, change the role of firm agility. we show that the link between the national\\u002findustry level of digitalization and firm agility is statistically robust and essential. we study the link on data from 2009 to 2018 in fifteen eu advanced economies using dynamic panel data modeling. the digitalization impact level differs across firms by ownership type (family to non-family firms). agility in family firms is strongly influenced by the national\\u002findustry level of digitization and investments in intangible assets (particularly the creation of own-organizational capital). non-family firms' agility depends on investment in human capital, design, and creation of new products and minorly on national\\u002findustry digitalization level. digitalization and gross investments in intangible assets can increase family firm agility exponentially (elasticity coefficient of 85 for-profit margins). policymakers using policy supporting national\\u002findustry digitalization can boost economic growth significantly. managers and practitioners targeting specific investments in intangible assets can improve and increase firm agility to large extents.\",\"business analytics-enabled decision-making effectiveness through knowledge absorptive capacity in health care. purpose: drawing on the resource-based theory and dynamic capability view, this paper aims to examine the mechanisms by which business analytics (ba) capabilities (i.e. the effective use of data aggregation, analytics and data interpretation tools) in healthcare units indirectly influence decision-making effectiveness through the mediating role of knowledge absorptive capacity. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: using a survey method, this study collected data from the hospitals in taiwan. of the 155 responses received, three were incomplete, giving a 35.84 per cent response rate with 152 valid data points. structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. findings: this study conceptualizes, operationalizes and measures the ba capability as a multi-dimensional construct that is formed by capturing the functionalities of ba systems in health care, leading to the conclusion that healthcare units are likely to obtain valuable knowledge through using the data analysis and interpretation tools effectively. the effective use of data analysis and interpretation tools in healthcare units indirectly influence decision-making effectiveness, an impact that is mediated by absorptive capacity. originality\\u002fvalue: this study adds values to the literature by conceptualizing ba capabilities in healthcare and demonstrating how knowledge absorption matters when implementing ba to the decision-making process. the mediating role of absorptive capacity not only provides a mechanism by which ba can contribute to decision-making practices but also offers a new solution to the puzzle of the it productivity paradox in healthcare settings.\",\"how data-driven innovation capability is shaping the future of market agility and competitive performance?. in the race to achieve market dominance and stay competitive in a disruptive and rapidly changing business environment, many firms have invested significantly in data-driven innovation capabilities (ddic). surprisingly, the role that strategic market agility plays in achieving a firm's competitiveness through ddic is understudied. addressing this gap, we conceptualize the ddic research model using the resource-based view, dynamic capability, market orientation and disruptive innovation theory. we empirically test the model with survey data from 312 australian managers. we illuminate the significance of strategic market agility as a key mediator between ddic and strategic competitive performance. we discuss the implications of our findings for theoretical contributions and managerial implications.\",\"experimentation with strategy and the evolution of dynamic capability in the indian pharmaceutical sector. this article demonstrates that radical regulatory changes can be tantamount to technological revolutions by studying indian pharmaceutical firms. it shows that radical regulatory changes such as the indian patent act of 1970, the new industrial policy of 1991 and the signing of trips (trade related intellectual property rights system) in 1995 served to open up new economic opportunities and constraints in the wake of which the winners and losers were selected as a function of the dynamic firm capabilities most appropriate for the new market environment.\",\"digital innovation and performance of manufacturing firms: an affordance perspective. we explore the underlying mechanisms and institutional conditions of profiting from digital innovation in the context of manufacturing firms. building on affordance theory, we propose that digital innovations positively affect manufacturing firms\\u2019 performance via innovation speed and operational efficiency due to the affordance of digital technology. moreover, the interactions between digital and institutional affordances suggest that the intellectual property rights (ipr) protection system (i.e. ipr regime and its enforcement) negatively moderates the relationship between digital innovation adoption and innovation speed, as well as operational efficiency. results from a longitudinal sample of chinese listed firms support our hypotheses. our findings contribute to the emerging literature on profiting from digital innovation and provide managerial implications for manufacturing firms in emerging markets.\",\"the role of information governance in big data analytics driven innovation. the age of big data analytics is now here, with companies increasingly investing in big data initiatives to foster innovation and outperform competition. nevertheless, while researchers and practitioners started to examine the shifts that these technologies entail and their overall business value, it is still unclear whether and under what conditions they drive innovation. to address this gap, this study draws on the resource-based view (rbv) of the firm and information governance theory to explore the interplay between a firm's big data analytics capabilities (bdacs) and their information governance practices in shaping innovation capabilities. we argue that a firm's bdac helps enhance two distinct types of innovative capabilities, incremental and radical capabilities, and that information governance positively moderates this relationship. to examine our research model, we analyzed survey data collected from 175 it and business managers. results from partial least squares structural equation modelling analysis reveal that bdacs have a positive and significant effect on both incremental and radical innovative capabilities. our analysis also highlights the important role of information governance, as it positively moderates the relationship between bdac's and a firm's radical innovative capability, while there is a nonsignificant moderating effect for incremental innovation capabilities. finally, we examine the effect of environmental uncertainty conditions in our model and find that information governance and bdacs have amplified effects under conditions of high environmental dynamism.\",\"digital technology adoption, digital dynamic capability, and digital transformation performance of textile industry: moderating role of digital innovation orientation. in the new manufacturing area, the chinese textile industry is facing the opportunities and challenges under the sustainable development model and advanced manufacturing technology. it is urgent to use digital technology to realize digital transformation. in this process, digital dynamic capability and digital innovation are significant for textile firms to achieve digital transformation performance. drawing on the data from 367 questionnaires of chinese textile firms, we apply multiple regression to examine how a firm's digital transformation is affected by adopting digital technology. a conceptual model based on framework of resource\\u2013capability\\u2013performance is developed to examine how adoption of digital technology, digital dynamic capability, and digital innovation orientation affects a firm's digital transformation performance. the results indicate that the positive relationship between digital technology adoption and digital transformation performance is less significant; this path is fully mediated through digital dynamic capability. digital innovation orientation has a positive moderating effect and that the efficiency digital innovation has the most significant moderating effect among all digital innovation types. in addition, compared with textile firms in the low level of digital technology adoption, the firms in the high-level group show a significant positive relationship between digital technology adoption and digital transformation performance. these findings confirm the validity of the model and contribute to existing literature on technology efforts in firms and provide guidelines to help managers implement informed decisions about digital transformation.\",\"unto the breach: what the covid-19 pandemic exposes about digitalization. much recent scholarly investigation has been focused on the promise of digitalization and the new ways of working and organizing it makes possible. in this paper, we analyze how the covid-19 pandemic has acted as a natural breaching experiment that has challenged taken-for-granted expectations about digitalization and revealed four important issues: uneven access to digital infrastructures, the persistence of the analog in digitalization, the brittleness of unchecked digitalization, and panoptical surveillance. the sudden shift to digital work has exposed taken-for-granted assumptions about the universality of digital access. the crisis has also revealed that many highly digitalized processes still rely on analog elements. the pandemic has also exposed that many algorithms used in digitalized inter-organizational processes are brittle due to overreliance on historic patterns. finally, the pandemic has breached fundamental expectations of privacy when organizational surveillance was extended into private and public spaces. thus, the pandemic has laid bare fundamental challenges in digitalization and has exposed the limits of rose\\u2011tinted thinking about the relation between technology and organizing.\",\"innovation and entrepreneurship studies: one or two fields of research?. as we have moved towards a more knowledge intensive society, innovation and industrial dynamics have grown in importance over the last 40-50 years. we are frequently using concepts such as innovation and entrepreneurship, and the way we perceive and define these concepts will to a high extent influence our way of thinking and acting. depending on the way we define these concepts, we will tend to use different knowledge-bases when acting as policy-makers, or as researchers. therefore, it becomes important to elaborate on the knowledge bases that we have within the fields of innovation and entrepreneurship. this study we elaborate on the question: can innovation and entrepreneurship be seen as one or two fields of research? we will elaborate on this issue by comparing the core works in innovation and entrepreneurship studies respectively, as identified by fagerberg et al. (research policy 41(7):1121\\u20131131, 2012a) and landstr\\u00f6m et al. (research policy 41(7):1154\\u20131181, 2012), asking the questions: who are the leading knowledge producers and the core works in the two fields? are there overlaps in the literature used? and can the existence or absence of overlaps tell us anything about to what extent innovation and entrepreneurship studies can be considered as two fields or parts of a single broader scientific field, sharing and contributing to the same knowledge base? the studies by fagerberg et al. and landstr\\u00f6m et al. are based on two unique databases consisting of all references in twelve \\u201cstate-of-the-art\\u201d books in entrepreneurship studies and eleven books in innovation studies. the chapters in these \\u201cstate-of-the-art\\u201d books are written by experts within the field, and it can be assumed that the most frequently cited references in these chapters represent \\u201ccore knowledge\\u201d in entrepreneurship and innovation research. the study shows that we are talking about two more or less separate fields of research. despite common roots in schumpeter and some interrelated works, the two fields seem to have drifted apart over the last decades. however, there seems to be some elements of overlaps, for example, in the interest in the evolutionary approaches and in geographic differences in innovation and entrepreneurship, but also in an interest in topics such as innovation management (corporate entrepreneurship) and in technology-based ventures.\",\"the role of compatibility in predicting business intelligence and analytics use intentions. research shows that data-driven decision-making using business intelligence and analytics (bi&a) can create competitive advantages for organizations. however, this can only happen if users successfully accept bi&a and use it effectively. analytical decision processes are often characterized by non-routine and ill-structured tasks and decisions, making individuals\\u2019 work styles more pronounced. aligning on one hand what a bi&a solution can offer and, on the other, the changing needs and expectations of users, the way they like to work \\u2013 their work style, can thus be difficult. this illustrates the importance of compatibility evaluations in the bi&a context, including perceptions of the technology fit with the user's work needs and style, along with the fit with the organizational decision processes and organizational values when deciding to use bi&a. these issues have not yet been thoroughly researched in the existing bi&a literature. in response, we conduct a quantitative survey-based study to examine the interrelated role of compatibility in predicting bi&a use intentions. the model is empirically tested with the partial least squares (pls) approach through to structural equation modeling (sem). our results show that compatibility perceptions have a direct positive impact on use intentions, mediate the impact of performance perceptions on use intentions, while the socio-organizational considerations of result demonstrability and social influence have interaction effects by positively strengthening the perceived relevance of compatibility in impacting use intentions.\",\"knowledge management and intellectual capital - the new virtuous reality of competitiveness. the nature and rationale of, and the preconditions and imperatives for, an effective practice of knowledge management (km) are outlined briefly, km engenders and encompasses a dynamic nexus of organizational learning, innovation, skills, competencies, expertise and capabilities. it evolves and graduates toward the development of a company's intellectual capital (ic). the latter is defined here as the holistic meta-level capability of an organization to generate creative and effective responses to extant and emerging, present and potential challenges facing it, in an ongoing manner. both km and ic represent modes of competitiveness based on the individual and collective brain power of people. the latter however, cannot be harnessed in the absence of a social fabric of virtuous reality. virtuous reality comprises an ethos of trust and co-operation, sincerity and goodwill, help and care, shared values and vision. the inner virtuous reality of an enterprise thence shapes the outer reality of its competitiveness.\",\"big data and analytics in tourism and hospitality: a perspective article. purpose: this study aims to discuss the evolution of big data (bd) and analytics in the tourism and hospitality field. it analyses the important role that bd has played so far in tourism and hospitality research and delineates how it might evolve in the future. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: in line with the platinum jubilee special issue of tourism review, this work consists of a critical and conceptual analysis including a mini literature review of recent work in the area at the intersection of bd and tourism and hospitality research. findings: findings suggest that tourism and hospitality scholars are increasingly aware of and adopting bd approaches to retrieve, collect, analyse, report and visualise their data. however, a number of avenues for improvement in the use and interpretation of bd and bd analytics as both sets of methods and technology need to be developed. moreover, bd analytics promise to enhance a number of digital technologies in tourism and hospitality such as ai and iot that heavily rely on data. as such, the authors envision that a new digital entrepreneurship field might be shaped within the tourism and hospitality literature. research pathways for future inquiry at the intersection of bd and tourism and hospitality are outlined. originality\\u002fvalue: while thinking retrospectively about research revolving around bd and its role in the tourism and hospitality research field so far, this study also addresses the challenges pertaining to how bd research will be conducted in the next seven decades within tourism and hospitality.\",\"how does digital transformation improve organizational resilience?\\u2014findings from pls-sem and fsqca. digital transformation has become a critical path for enterprises to improve organizational resilience, and has been widely considered by both academia and business practice. however, the extant literature focuses on the concepts and antecedents of digital transformation and the outcomes of digital transformation, lacking of exploring the effect mechanism of digital transformation of enterprises on organizational resilience. based on the perspective of dynamic capacity and the theoretical path of \\u201cdigital transformation\\u2014ambidextrous innovation\\u2014organizational resilience\\u201d, this study constructs a theoretical model to explore a path where digital transformation affects both exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation, and further affects the organizational resilience of enterprises. by performing a questionnaire investigation with 339 chinese enterprises, this study adopted both a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsqca) and structural equation modeling (sem) to explore the relationships among digital transformation, ambidextrous innovation, and organizational resilience. the results show that the digital transformation of enterprises helps to improve organizational resilience. additionally, digital transformation has a positive impact on the organizational resilience of enterprises mediated by both exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation. finally, both exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation of enterprises have a positive impact on organizational resilience, and there is a complementary relationship between exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation. further qualitative comparative analysis also shows that there are three types of configurations for achieving organizational resilience: digital transformation and exploitative innovation, digital transformation and exploratory innovation, and exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation. the paper is concluded by highlighting the importance of the practical significance for enterprises to effectively carry out digital transformation and further achieve organizational resilience.\",\"big data analytics and artificial intelligence pathway to operational performance under the effects of entrepreneurial orientation and environmental dynamism: a study of manufacturing organisations. the importance of big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning has been at the forefront of research for operations and supply chain management. literature has reported the influence of big data analytics for improved operational performance, but there has been a paucity of research regarding the role of entrepreneurial orientation (eo) on the adoption of big data analytics. to address this gap, we draw on the dynamic capabilities view of firms and on contingency theory to develop and test a model that describes the role of eo on the adoption of big data analytics powered by artificial intelligence (bda-ai) and operational performance (op). we tested our research hypotheses using a survey of 256 responses gathered using a pre-tested questionnaire from manufacturing firms in india with the help of the national association of software and services companies (nasscom) and the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry (ficci). the results from our analysis indicate that eo enables an organisation to exploit and further explore the bda-ai capabilities to achieve superior op. further, our results provide empirical evidence based on data analysis that eo is strongly associated with higher order capabilities (such as bda-ai) and op under differential effects of environmental dynamism (ed). these findings extend the dynamic capability view and contingency theory to create better understanding of dynamic capabilities of the organisation while also providing theoretically grounded guidance to the managers to align their eo with their technological capabilities within their firms.\",\"emerging regional innovation policies for industry 4.0: analyzing the digital innovation hub program in european regions. purpose: industry 4.0 or digitization, from a regional innovation system (ris) and policy perspective to improve regional innovation, is over-looked. specifically, this paper aims to focus on analyzing the nascent european commission (ec) digital innovation hub (dih) program, designed for fostering transition into industry 4.0 in regions and facilitating new path development. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: empirically, 10 spanish dih is explored

the first study on the topic.\",\"artificial intelligence and big data in entrepreneurship: a new era has begun. while the disruptive potential of artificial intelligence (ai) and big data has been receiving growing attention and concern in a variety of research and application fields over the last few years, it has not received much scrutiny in contemporary entrepreneurship research so far. here we present some reflections and a collection of papers on the role of ai and big data for this emerging area in the study and application of entrepreneurship research. while being mindful of the potentially overwhelming nature of the rapid progress in machine intelligence and other big data technologies for contemporary structures in entrepreneurship research, we put an emphasis on the reciprocity of the co-evolving fields of entrepreneurship research and practice. how can ai and big data contribute to a productive transformation of the research field and the real-world phenomena (e.g., \\u201csmart entrepreneurship\\u201d)? we also discuss, however, ethical issues as well as challenges around a potential contradiction between entrepreneurial uncertainty and rule-driven ai rationality. the editorial gives researchers and practitioners orientation and showcases avenues and examples for concrete research in this field. at the same time, however, it is not unlikely that we will encounter unforeseeable and currently inexplicable developments in the field soon. we call on entrepreneurship scholars, educators, and practitioners to proactively prepare for future

development status in support of technology forecasting and assessment. this paper integrates bibliometrics with qualitative methodologies and visualisation techniques to construct a hybrid model for composing technology roadmaps. the mapping arrays details on the evolution of the technology under study and contributes to understanding the macro-technology development status. we generate a global technology roadmap for electric vehicles to demonstrate the approach in an empirical study.\",\"creating strategic business value from big data analytics: a research framework. despite the publicity regarding big data and analytics (bda), the success rate of these projects and strategic value created from them are unclear. most literature on bda focuses on how it can be used to enhance tactical organizational capabilities, but very few studies examine its impact on organizational value. further, we see limited framing of how bda can create strategic value for the organization. after all, the ultimate success of any bda project lies in realizing strategic business value, which gives firms a competitive advantage. in this study, we describe the value proposition of bda by delineating its components. we offer a framing of bda value by extending existing frameworks of information technology value, then illustrate the framework through bda applications in practice. the framework is then discussed in terms of its ability to study constructs and relationships that focus on bda value creation and realization. we also present a problem-oriented view of the framework\\u2014where problems in bda components can give rise to targeted research questions and areas for future study. the framing in this study could help develop a significant research agenda for bda that can better target research and practice based on effective use of data resources. copyright\",\"the net-enabled business innovation cycle and the evolution of dynamic capabilities. wheeler's net-enabled business innovation cycle (nebic) integrates is and strategy research to offer an interesting and timely perspective on value creation. we extend wheeler's theoretical propositions, highlighting the interplay between strategy, is, and entrepreneurship in a quest for competitive advantage. this interplay is crucial to the creation of the dynamic capabilities that enable companies to gain an advantage through nebic. the importance of opportunity recognition and absorptive capacity in bringing about the changes that make nebic viable is also highlighted.\",\"digital transformation challenges: strategies emerging from a multi-stakeholder approach. purpose: this paper proposes adequate strategies that companies, public administrators and organisations in the education industry can undertake to successfully face the challenges of digital transformation in a regional innovation system. this research considers stakeholders that operate in the tyrol\\u2013veneto macroregion (the tyrol, south tyrol and veneto areas), a significant case of moderately innovative european macroregion. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this study undertakes explorative research based on a qualitative method. it adopts a place-based multi-stakeholder approach to emphasise the role of three categories of stakeholders (companies, educational system and regional governments) in facing digital changes. more precisely, interviews with 60 stakeholders from the tyrol\\u2013veneto macroregion were conducted and examined via both text mining analysis and content analysis. first, correspondence factor analysis was performed using iramuteq software to identify homogeneous subsets of concepts (pillars\\u2013i.e., macroareas of strategic actions). second, two coding phases were implemented using nvivo software to detect strategic fields of action and specific strategic actions undertaken to address the challenges of digital transformation. findings: the results highlight that digital transformation is a pervasive challenge of regional innovative system that requires a multifaceted set of strategic actions falling into three main pillars. the first pillar, named \\u201cculture and skills\\u201d, includes three strategic fields of action as follows: digital education, talents and digital culture. the second pillar, named \\u201cinfrastructures and technologies\\u201d, points out the need of information, interaction and artificial intelligence as key strategic fields of action. the third pillar, named \\u201cecosystems\\u201d, highlights the importance of investing in medium- to long-term visions, partnerships and life quality. in brief, this study shows that standalone interventions are insufficient to tackle digital transformation from a systemic perspective. moreover, this study outlines the potential contribution of each category of stakeholder to foster the digitalisation of the tyrol\\u2013veneto macroregion. practical implications: this study highlights the importance of developing digital culture and skills before investing in digital infrastructure and technology in a moderately innovative macroregion. companies should alter their vision before reconfiguring their business models, invest in smart working and establish contacts with start-ups. in addition, this study recommends that public administration should mainly invest in digital education and partnerships, while, in terms of education and training organisations, it suggests providing digital skills to several cohorts of both students and workers. policy implications call for the creation of new occasions of cooperation among stakeholders by fostering \\u201ctable talks\\u201d as strategic and policy actions and by making more financial resources available to encourage the digital transformation processes. originality\\u002fvalue: the results of this study may be adapted to the characteristics of other regional innovative systems and used as a reference point in terms of the improvement of business, market and local development.\",\"information technology and organizational capabilities: a longitudinal study of the apparel industry. business value of information technology (it) is one of the most important research streams in information systems (is) research. in this study, we follow the resource-based view (rbv) in strategy literature to study how it enables firms to develop new organizational capabilities. using structured content analysis, we have collected longitudinal data from news media for 49 publicly traded apparel firms in the u.s. over the period of 1995 to 2007. the financial data were collected from standard & poor's compustat data. in this research, we study how it assets affect apparel firms' organizational capabilities such as operational capability, customer service, and ability to innovate. the u.s. apparel industry is largely heterogeneous in its use of it and organizational capabilities, and therefore provides a particularly interesting case to investigate the relationship between them. our empirical results show that it can lead to higher level of organizational capabilities. firm financial resources are important in affecting the relationship between it and operational efficiency as well as the relationship between it and customer service. in addition, we find that operational efficiency plays a mediating role in how it affects customer service.\",\"examining the role of logistics 4.0 enabled dynamic capabilities on firm performance. purpose: the study investigates the effect of technological capabilities, organizational capabilities and environmental capabilities on logistics 4.0 capabilities and also examines the effect of logistics 4.0 capabilities on firm performance. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the proposed theoretical framework is tested using warppls 6.0 software. we selected samples from the automotive component and allied manufacturers in south africa. initially, we sent the structured questionnaire online using google forms to 800 potential respondents. after doing follow ups, we received 230 completed survey responses. further, data preparation is done using established scientific approach and we checked suitability of its use in structural equation modelling. after ensuring all necessary checks are completed, the results are found satisfactory to further proceed with testing of research hypotheses. findings: it is observed that technological capabilities, organizational capabilities and environmental capabilities show significant effect on logistics 4.0 capabilities. however, the outcome of technological capabilities and environmental capabilities on logistics 4.0 capabilities (\\u00df = 0.27) is found stronger than organizational capabilities. logistics 4.0 capabilities shows significant effect on firm performance. practical implications: it is important that the sustainability goals are aligned with logistics 4.0 strategies. managers need to increase focus towards development of logistics 4.0 dynamic capabilities that enhance agility and responsiveness in the supply chain. managers should check the financial performance and market conditions continuously to further review logistics performance as this can influence the overall firm performance. originality\\u002fvalue: this study advances the literature on logistics 4.0 applications in operations management by investigating the key links such as logistics 4.0 capability development and firm performance.\",\"technological opportunism and radical technology adoption: an application to e-business. using the resource-based view of the firm, the authors hypothesize that differences in adoption of radical technologies among firms can be attributed to a sense-and-respond capability of firms with respect to new technologies, which is termed technological opportunism. using survey data from senior managers in business-to-business firms, the authors study the adoption of e-business, a radical technology with the potential to alter business models. the authors first establish the distinctiveness of technological opportunism from related constructs, such as organizational innovativeness, and show that it offers a significantly better explanation of technology adoption than existing constructs do. in a follow-up survey of senior managers, the authors investigate the antecedents of technological opportunism and find that organizations can develop technological opportunism by taking specific actions such as focusing on the future, by having top management advocate new technologies, and by becoming more of an adhocracy culture and less of a hierarchy culture. the proposed technological opportunism construct can inform theory development on the relative emphasis on internal (research and development) versus external (buying, licensing) development of technologies and the complementarities in technology orientation and market orientation in the firm. the results can be used by managers who seek to develop the technological opportunism capability of their firms and by those in technology vendor firms

usage, expected job sustainability, and perceived job insecurity. this study analyzes u.s.-based survey data from the pew research center and explores the relationships between perceived job insecurity, technology usage, and long-term projection on the transition toward the fourth industrial revolution. keen attention to the upcoming predicted changes in job, work, and employment due to technological revolution, such as robotics and artificial intelligence, will help fill a gap in prior research that heavily emphasized organizational and psychological aspects of job insecurity. the findings show that employees\\u2019 present perception of job insecurity is highly associated with technology usage and long-term perceptions of job and work. this article contributes to a new direction of job insecurity research (i.e., linkage of job insecurity as an organizational and psychological concept with attitudes about technology adoption and use) and proposes practical suggestions (e.g., a proactive approach to adapting to technology-driven changes in organizations) to prepare for the transition toward the fourth industrial revolution.\",\"artificial intelligence (ai) in urology-current use and future directions: an itrue study. objective: artificial intelligence (ai) is used in various urological conditions such as urolithiasis, pediatric urology, urogynecology, benign prostate hyperplasia (bph), renal transplant, and uro-oncology. the various models of ai and its application in urology subspecialties are reviewed and discussed. material and methods: search strategy was adapted to identify and review the literature pertaining to the application of ai in urology using the keywords \\u201curology,\\u201d \\u201cartificial intelligence,\\u201d \\u201cmachine learning,\\u201d \\u201cdeep learning,\\u201d \\u201cartificial neural networks,\\u201d \\u201ccomputer vision,\\u201d and \\u201cnatural language processing\\u201d were included and categorized. review articles, editorial comments, and non-urologic studies were excluded. results: the article reviewed 47 articles that reported characteristics and implementation of ai in urologi-cal cancer. in all cases with benign conditions, artificial intelligence was used to predict outcomes of the surgical procedure. in urolithiasis, it was used to predict stone composition, whereas in pediatric urology and bph, it was applied to predict the severity of condition. in cases with malignant conditions, it was applied to predict the treatment response, survival, prognosis, and recurrence on the basis of the genomic and biomarker studies. these results were also found to be statistically better than routine approaches. application of radiomics in classification and nuclear grading of renal masses, cystoscopic diagnosis of bladder cancers, predicting gleason score, and magnetic resonance imaging with computer-assisted diagnosis for prostate cancers are few applications of ai that have been studied extensively. conclusions: in the near future, we will see a shift in the clinical paradigm as ai applications will find their place in the guidelines and revolutionize the decision-making process.\",\"innovation analytics: leveraging artificial intelligence in the innovation process. artificial intelligence (ai) is about imbuing machines with a kind of intelligence that is mainly attributed to humans. extant literature\\u2014coupled with our experiences as practitioners\\u2014suggests that while ai may not be ready to completely take over highly creative tasks within the innovation process, it shows promise as a significant support to innovation managers. in this article, we broadly refer to the derivation of computer-enabled, data-driven insights, models, and visualizations within the innovation process as innovation analytics. ai can play a key role in the innovation process by driving multiple aspects of innovation analytics. we present four different case studies of ai in action based on our previous work in the field. we highlight benefits and limitations of using ai in innovation and conclude with strategic implications and additional resources for innovation managers.\",\"urban artificial intelligence: from automation to autonomy in the smart city. technological innovation is constantly reshaping the materiality and mechanics of smart-city initiatives. recently, innovation in artificial intelligence (ai) in the shape of self-driving cars, robots and city brains, has been pushing the so-called smart city to morph into an autonomous urban creature which is largely unknown. in this emerging strand of smart urbanism, artificially intelligent entities are taking the management of urban services as well as urban governance out of the hands of humans, operating the city in an autonomous manner. this paper explores, in theory and practice, how the development of ai intersects with the development of the city. the contribution of the paper is threefold. first, the paper advances a theoretical framework to understand ai specifically in urban contexts. it develops the concept of urban artificial intelligence, capturing the main manifestations of ai in cities. second, the paper examines the case of masdar city, an emirati urban experiment, to show how the genesis of urban artificial intelligences is part of a long-standing process of technological development and a politico-economic agenda which together are enabling the transition from automation to autonomy. third, it proposes a research agenda to investigate what the paper terms the autonomous city. copyright\",\"a very brief introduction to machine learning with applications to communication systems. given the unprecedented availability of data and computing resources, there is widespread renewed interest in applying data-driven machine learning methods to problems for which the development of conventional engineering solutions is challenged by modeling or algorithmic deficiencies. this tutorial-style paper starts by addressing the questions of why and when such techniques can be useful. it then provides a high-level introduction to the basics of supervised and unsupervised learning. for both supervised and unsupervised learning, exemplifying applications to communication networks are discussed by distinguishing tasks carried out at the edge and at the cloud segments of the network at different layers of the protocol stack, with an emphasis on the physical layer.\",\"artificial intelligence and business strategy towards digital transformation: a research agenda. in the past decade, current literature and businesses have drawn attention to artificial intelligence (ai) tools and in particular to the advances in machine learning techniques. nevertheless, while the ai technology offers great potential to solve difficulties, challenges remain implicated in practical implementation and lack of expertise in the strategic usage of ai to create business value. this paper aims to implement a systematic literature review analyzing convergence of the ai and corporate strategy and develop a theoretical model incorporating issues based on the existing research in this field. eighty-one peer-reviewed articles were discussed on the basis of research methodology from webster and watson (2002). in addition to gaps in future research, a theoretical model is developed, discussing the four sources of value creation: ai and machine learning in organizations; alignment of ai tools and information technology (it) with organizational strategy; ai, knowledge management and decision-making process; and ai, service innovation and value. these outcomes lead to both theoretical and managerial viewpoints, with extensive possibilities to generate new methods and types of management practices.\",\"ready or not, ai comes\\u2014 an interview study of organizational ai readiness factors. artificial intelligence (ai) offers organizations much potential. considering the manifold application areas, ai\\u2019s inherent complexity, and new organizational necessities, companies encounter pitfalls when adopting ai. an informed decision regarding an organization\\u2019s readiness increases the probability of successful ai adoption and is important to successfully leverage ai\\u2019s business value. thus, companies need to assess whether their assets, capabilities, and commitment are ready for the individual ai adoption purpose. research on ai readiness and ai adoption is still in its infancy. consequently, researchers and practitioners lack guidance on the adoption of ai. the paper presents five categories of ai readiness factors and their illustrative actionable indicators. the ai readiness factors are deduced from an in-depth interview study with 25 ai experts and triangulated with both scientific and practitioner literature. thus, the paper provides a sound set of organizational ai readiness factors, derives corresponding indicators for ai readiness assessments, and discusses the general implications for ai adoption. this is a first step toward conceptualizing relevant organizational ai readiness factors and guiding purposeful decisions in the entire ai adoption process for both research and practice.\",\"artificial intelligence and fintech: an overview of opportunities and risks for banking, investments, and microfinance. artificial intelligence (ai) is creating a rush of opportunities in the financial sector, but financial organizations need to be aware of the risks inherent in the use of this technology. financial organizations are integrating ai in their operations: in-house, outsourced, or ecosystem-based. the growth of ai-based fintech firms has encouraged several mergers and acquisitions among financial service providers and wealth managers as they grapple with volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. ai's unique promise of combined cost reduction and increased differentiation makes it generally attractive across the board. however, perhaps other than fraud detection, these benefits depend on the scale of an organization. risk arises from nonrepresentative data, bias inherent in representative data, choice of algorithms, and human decisions, based on their ai interpretations (and whether humans are involved at all once ai has been unleashed). risk reduction requires a vigilant division of labour between ai and humans for the foreseeable future.\",\"the impact of automation on tourism and hospitality jobs. this viewpoint discusses the impacts of automation technologies on tourism and hospitality jobs by delving into the mechanisms through which automation eliminates, transforms, and creates job positions in the industry. it elaborates on the tourism and hospitality jobs of the future, the skills that tourism and hospitality employees would need, and the implication of automation for tourism and hospitality education.\",\"primer on artificial intelligence and robotics. this article provides an introduction to artificial intelligence, robotics, and research streams that examine the economic and organizational consequences of these and related technologies. we describe the nascent research on artificial intelligence and robotics in the economics and management literature and summarize the dominant approaches taken by scholars in this area. we discuss the implications of artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation for organizational design and firm strategy, argue for greater engagement with these topics by organizational and strategy researchers, and outline directions for future research.\",\"the janus face of artificial intelligence feedback: deployment versus disclosure effects on employee performance. companies are increasingly using artificial intelligence (ai) to provide performance feedback to employees, by tracking employee behavior at work, automating performance evaluations, and recommending job improvements. however, this application of ai has provoked much debate. on the one hand, powerful ai data analytics increase the quality of feedback, which may enhance employee productivity (\\u201cdeployment effect\\u201d). on the other hand, employees may develop a negative perception of ai feedback once it is disclosed to them, thus harming their productivity (\\u201cdisclosure effect\\u201d). we examine these two effects theoretically and test them empirically using data from a field experiment. we find strong evidence that both effects coexist, and that the adverse disclosure effect is mitigated by employees' tenure in the firm. these findings offer pivotal implications for management theory, practice, and public policies. managerial abstract: artificial intelligence (ai) technologies are bound to transform how companies manage employees. we examine the use of ai to generate performance feedback for employees. we demonstrate that ai significantly increases the accuracy and consistency of the analyses of information collected, and the relevance of feedback to each employee. these advantages of ai help employees achieve greater job performance at scale, and thus create value for companies. however, our study also alerts companies to the negative effect of disclosing using ai to employee that results from employees' negative perceptions about the deployment of ai, which offsets the business value created by ai. to alleviate value-destroying disclosure effect, we suggest that companies be more proactive in communicating with their employees about the objectives, benefits, and scope of ai applications in order to assuage their concerns. moreover, the result of the allayed negative ai disclosure effect among employees with a longer tenure in the company suggests that companies may consider deploying ai in a tiered instead of a uniform fashion, that is, using ai to provide performance feedback to veteran employees but using human managers to provide performance feedback to novices.\",\"coordinating human and machine learning for effective organizational learning. with the rise of machine learning (ml), humans are no longer the only ones capable of learning and contributing to an organization\\u2019s stock of knowledge. we study how organizations can coordinate human learning and ml in order to learn effectively as a whole. based on a series of agent-based simulations, we find that, first, ml can reduce an organization\\u2019s demand for human explorative learning that is aimed at uncovering new ideas; second, adjustments to ml systems made by humans are largely beneficial, but this effect can diminish or even become harmful under certain conditions; and third, reliance on knowledge created by ml systems can facilitate organizational learning in turbulent environments, but this requires significant investments in the initial setup of these systems as well as adequately coordinating them with humans. these insights contribute to rethinking organizational learning in the presence of ml and can aid organizations in reallocating scarce resources to facilitate organizational learning in practice.\",\"the rise of robots and the fall of routine jobs. this paper examines the impact of industrial robots on jobs. we combine data on robot adoption and occupations by industry in thirty-seven countries for the period from 2005 to 2015. we exploit differences across industries in technical feasibility \\u2013 defined as the industry's share of tasks replaceable by robots \\u2013 to identify the impact of robot usage on employment. the data allow us to differentiate effects by the routine-intensity of employment. we find that a rise in robot adoption relates significantly to a fall in the employment share of routine manual task-intensive jobs. this relation is observed in high-income countries, but not in emerging market and transition economies.\",\"artificial intelligence and machine learning as business tools: a framework for diagnosing value destruction potential. artificial intelligence (ai) and machine learning (ml) may save money and improve the efficiency of business processes, but these technologies can also destroy business value, sometimes with grave consequences. the inability to identify and manage that risk can lead some managers to delay the adoption of these technologies and thus prevent them from realizing their potential. this article proposes a new framework by which to map the components of an ai solution and to identify and manage the value-destruction potential of ai and ml for businesses. we show how the defining characteristics of ai and ml can threaten the integrity of the ai system's inputs, processes, and outcomes. we then draw from the concepts of value-creation content and value-creation process to show how these risks may hinder value creation or even result in value destruction. finally, we illustrate the application of our framework with an example of the deployment of an ai-powered chatbot in customer service, and we discuss how to remedy the problems that arise.\",\"artificial intelligence and patient-centered decision-making. advanced ai systems are rapidly making their way into medical research and practice, and, arguably, it is only a matter of time before they will surpass human practitioners in terms of accuracy, reliability, and knowledge. if this is true, practitioners will have a prima facie epistemic and professional obligation to align their medical verdicts with those of advanced ai systems. however, in light of their complexity, these ai systems will often function as black boxes: the details of their contents, calculations, and procedures cannot be meaningfully understood by human practitioners. when ai systems reach this level of complexity, we can also speak of black-box medicine. in this paper, we want to argue that black-box medicine conflicts with core ideals of patient-centered medicine. in particular, we claim, black-box medicine is not conducive for supporting informed decision-making based on shared information, shared deliberation, and shared mind between practitioner and patient.\",\"mapping the challenges of artificial intelligence in the public sector: evidence from public healthcare. the nascent adoption of artificial intelligence (ai) in the public sector is being assessed in contradictory ways. but while there is increasing speculation about both its dangers and its benefits, there is very little empirical research to substantiate them. this study aims at mapping the challenges in the adoption of ai in the public sector as perceived by key stakeholders. drawing on the theoretical lens of framing, we analyse a case of adoption of the ai system ibm watson in public healthcare in china, to map how three groups of stakeholders (government policy-makers, hospital managers\\u002fdoctors, and information technology (it) firm managers) perceive the challenges of ai adoption in the public sector. findings show that different stakeholders have diverse, and sometimes contradictory, framings of the challenges. we contribute to research by providing an empirical basis to claims of ai challenges in the public sector, and to practice by providing four sets of guidelines for the governance of ai adoption in the public sector.\",\"the fourth industrial revolution: issues and implications for career research and practice. the accelerating digitization and automation of work, known as the 4th industrial revolution, will have an enormous impact on individuals\\u2019 career experiences. yet, the academic literature in vocational psychology and career research has been remarkably silent on this trend so far. this article summarizes some of the most important issues of the 4th industrial revolution as they pertain to career development. the author then critically reviews how current models and frameworks of career development are suitable for addressing these emerging issues. opportunities for future career development research and practice are outlined.\",\"transparency in algorithmic and human decision-making: is there a double standard?. we are sceptical of concerns over the opacity of algorithmic decision tools. while transparency and explainability are certainly important desiderata in algorithmic governance, we worry that automated decision-making is being held to an unrealistically high standard, possibly owing to an unrealistically high estimate of the degree of transparency attainable from human decision-makers. in this paper, we review evidence demonstrating that much human decision-making is fraught with transparency problems, show in what respects ai fares little worse or better and argue that at least some regulatory proposals for explainable ai could end up setting the bar higher than is necessary or indeed helpful. the demands of practical reason require the justification of action to be pitched at the level of practical reason. decision tools that support or supplant practical reasoning should not be expected to aim higher than this. we cast this desideratum in terms of daniel dennett\\u2019s theory of the \\u201cintentional stance\\u201d and argue that since the justification of action for human purposes takes the form of intentional stance explanation, the justification of algorithmic decisions should take the same form. in practice, this means that the sorts of explanations for algorithmic decisions that are analogous to intentional stance explanations should be preferred over ones that aim at the architectural innards of a decision tool.\",\"technology, innovation, employment and power: does robotics and artificial intelligence really mean social transformation?. how far do recent innovations in robotics and artificial intelligence herald an unprecedented economic and social transformation? this article provides a critical evaluation of this question, challenging the relentless technological determinism of much debate, and reframing the issues involved within a political-economic and sociological approach. this focuses on the economic, political and historical dynamics of technological innovation, and its consequences for employment and economic re-structuring, mediated through sovereign and discursive power. a range of epistemological and empirical problems with the transformationist position are identified, and an alternative perspective proposed emphasizing complexity and uncertainty around contemporary and future trends.\",\"predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques. there are several areas in which organisations can adopt technologies that will support decision-making: artificial intelligence is one of the most innovative technologies that is widely used to assist organisations in business strategies, organisational aspects and people management. in recent years, attention has increasingly been paid to human resources (hr), since worker quality and skills represent a growth factor and a real competitive advantage for companies. after having been introduced to sales and marketing departments, artificial intelligence is also starting to guide employee-related decisions within hr management. the purpose is to support decisions that are based not on subjective aspects but on objective data analysis. the goal of this work is to analyse how objective factors influence employee attrition, in order to identify the main causes that contribute to a worker\\u2019s decision to leave a company, and to be able to predict whether a particular employee will leave the company. after the training, the obtained model for the prediction of employees\\u2019 attrition is tested on a real dataset provided by ibm analytics, which includes 35 features and about 1500 samples. results are expressed in terms of classical metrics and the algorithm that produced the best results for the available dataset is the gaussian na\\u00efve bayes classifier. it reveals the best recall rate (0.54), since it measures the ability of a classifier to find all the positive instances and achieves an overall false negative rate equal to 4.5% of the total observations.\",\"unlocking the value of artificial intelligence in human resource management through ai capability framework. artificial intelligence (ai) is increasingly adopted within human resource management (hrm) due to its potential to create value for consumers, employees, and organisations. however, recent studies have found that organisations are yet to experience the anticipated benefits from ai adoption, despite investing time, effort, and resources. the existing studies in hrm have examined the applications of ai, anticipated benefits, and its impact on human workforce and organisations. the aim of this paper is to systematically review the multi-disciplinary literature stemming from international business, information management, operations management, general management and hrm to provide a comprehensive and objective understanding of the organisational resources required to develop ai capability in hrm. our findings show that organisations need to look beyond technical resources, and put their emphasis on developing non-technical ones such as human skills and competencies, leadership, team co-ordination, organisational culture and innovation mindset, governance strategy, and ai-employee integration strategies, to benefit from ai adoption. based on these findings, we contribute five research propositions to advance ai scholarship in hrm. theoretically, we identify the organisational resources necessary to achieve business benefits by proposing the ai capability framework, integrating resource-based view and knowledge-based view theories. from a practitioner's standpoint, our framework offers a systematic way for the managers to objectively self-assess organisational readiness and develop strategies to adopt and implement ai-enabled practices and processes in hrm.\",\"economics of artificial intelligence: implications for the future of work. the current wave of technological change based on advancements in artificial intelligence (ai) has created widespread fear of job loss and further rises in inequality. this paper discusses the rationale for these fears, highlighting the specific nature of ai and comparing previous waves of automation and robotization with the current advancements made possible by a widespread adoption of ai. it argues that large opportunities in terms of increases in productivity can ensue, including for developing countries, given the vastly reduced costs of capital that some applications have demonstrated and the potential for productivity increases, especially among the low skilled. at the same time, risks in the form of further increases in inequality need to be addressed if the benefits from ai-based technological progress are to be broadly shared. for this, skills policies are necessary but not sufficient. in addition, new forms of regulating the digital economy are called for that prevent further rises in market concentration, ensure proper data protection and privacy, and help share the benefits of productivity growth through the combination of profit sharing, (digital) capital taxation, and a reduction in working time. the paper calls for a moderately optimistic outlook on the opportunities and risks from ai, provided that policymakers and social partners take the particular characteristics of these new technologies into account.\",\"rising with the machines: a sociotechnical framework for bringing artificial intelligence into the organization. artificial intelligence (ai) is increasingly being adopted by organizations, yet implementation is often carried out without careful consideration of the employees who will be working along with it. if employees do not understand or work with ai, it is unlikely to bring value to an organization. the purpose of this paper is to investigate the ways in which employees and ai can collaborate to build different levels of sociotechnical capital. accordingly, we develop a model of ai integration based on socio-technical systems (sts) theory that combines ai novelty and scope dimensions. we take an organizational socialization approach to build an understanding of the process of integrating ai into the organization. our framework underscores the importance of ai socialization as a core process in successfully integrating ai systems and employees. we conclude with a future research agenda that highlights the cognitive, relational, and structural implications of integrating ai and employees.\",\"the wrong kind of ai? artificial intelligence and the future of labour demand. artificial intelligence (ai) is set to influence every aspect of our lives, not least the way production is organised. ai, as a technology platform, can automate tasks previously performed by labour or create new tasks and activities in which humans can be productively employed. recent technological change has been biased towards automation, with insufficient focus on creating new tasks where labour can be productively employed. the consequences of this choice have been stagnating labour demand, declining labour share in national income, rising inequality and lowering productivity growth. the current tendency is to develop ai in the direction of further automation, but this might mean missing out on the promise of the 'right' kind of ai, with better economic and social outcomes.\",\"sociotechnical envelopment of artificial intelligence: an approach to organizational deployment of inscrutable artificial intelligence systems. the paper presents an approach for implementing inscrutable (i.e., nonexplainable) artificial intelligence (ai) such as neural networks in an accountable and safe manner in organizational settings. drawing on an exploratory case study and the recently proposed concept of envelopment, it describes a case of an organization successfully \\u201cenveloping\\u201d its ai solutions to balance the performance benefits of flexible ai models with the risks that inscrutable models can entail. the authors present several envelopment methods\\u2014establishing clear boundaries within which the ai is to interact with its surroundings, choosing and curating the training data well, and appropriately managing input and output sources\\u2014alongside their influence on the choice of ai models within the organization. this work makes two key contributions: it introduces the concept of sociotechnical envelopment by demonstrating the ways in which an organization\\u2019s successful ai envelopment depends on the interaction of social and technical factors, thus extending the literature\\u2019s focus beyond mere technical issues. secondly, the empirical examples illustrate how operationalizing a sociotechnical envelopment enables an organization to manage the trade-off between low explainability and high performance presented by inscrutable models. these contributions pave the way for more responsible, accountable ai implementations in organizations, whereby humans can gain better control of even inscrutable machine-learning models.\",\"artificial intelligence capability: conceptualization, measurement calibration, and empirical study on its impact on organizational creativity and firm performance. artificial intelligence (ai) has been heralded by many as the next source of business value. grounded on the resource-based theory of the firm and on recent work on ai at the organizational context, this study (1) identifies the ai-specific resources that jointly create an ai capability and provides a definition, (2) develops an instrument to capture the ai capability of the firms, and (3) examines the relationship between an ai capability and organizational creativity and performance. findings empirically support the suggested theoretical framework and corresponding instrument and provide evidence that an ai capability results in increased organizational creativity and performance.\",\"simultaneous optimization of artificial neural networks for financial forecasting. artificial neural networks (anns) have been popularly applied for stock market prediction, since they offer superlative learning ability. however, they often result in inconsistent and unpredictable performance in the prediction of noisy financial data due to the problems of determining factors involved in design. prior studies have suggested genetic algorithm (ga) to mitigate the problems, but most of them are designed to optimize only one or two architectural factors of ann. with this background, the paper presents a global optimization approach of ann to predict the stock price index. in this study, ga optimizes multiple architectural factors and feature transformations of ann to relieve the limitations of the conventional backpropagation algorithm synergistically. experiments show our proposed model outperforms conventional approaches in the prediction of the stock price index.\",\"ai cheerleaders: public relations, neoliberalism and artificial intelligence. public relations\\u2019 (pr) professional habitus is defined by a relentless focus on optimism and futurity. this professional habitus renders pr indispensable to the corporate world after crisis, when new, potentially controversial, growth strategies must be sold-in to stakeholders. this article argues that pr\\u2019s professional habitus is heavily influenced by neoliberalism, an ideology which \\u2018confidently identifies itself with the future\\u2019. the discussion is timely, as 21st-century neoliberal capitalism becomes redefined by artificial intelligence (ai). the article combines pr theory, communications theory and political economy to consider the changing shape of neoliberal capitalism, as ai becomes naturalised as \\u2018common sense\\u2019 and a \\u2018public good\\u2019. the article explores how pr supports ai discourses, including promoting ai in national competitiveness and promoting \\u2018friendly\\u2019 ai to consumers, while promoting internet inequalities. the article concludes that the pr profession\\u2019s myopia regarding the implications of promoting ai and neoliberalism is shaped by poor levels of diversity in the pr profession.\",\"the demand for ai skills in the labor market. using detailed data on skill requirements in online vacancies, we estimate the demand for ai specialists across occupations, sectors, and firms. we document a dramatic increase in the demand for ai skills over 2010\\u20132019 in the u.s. economy across most industries and occupations. the demand is highest in it occupations, followed by architecture and engineering, scientific, and management occupations. firms with larger market capitalization, higher cash holdings, and higher investments in r&d have a higher demand for ai skills. we also document a wage premium of 11% for job postings that require ai skills within the same firm and 5% within the same job title. managerial occupations have the highest wage premium for ai skills. firms demanding ai skills more intensively also offer higher salaries in non-ai jobs.\",\"role of artificial intelligence in shaping consumer demand in e-commerce. the advent and incorporation of technology in businesses have reformed operations across industries. notably, major technical shifts in e-commerce aim to influence customer behavior in favor of some products and brands. artificial intelligence (ai) comes on board as an essential innovative tool for personalization and customizing products to meet specific demands. this research finds that, despite the contribution of ai systems in e-commerce, its ethical soundness is a contentious issue, especially regarding the concept of explainability. the study adopted the use of word cloud analysis, voyance analysis, and concordance analysis to gain a detailed understanding of the idea of explainability as has been utilized by researchers in the context of ai. motivated by a corpus analysis, this research lays the groundwork for a uniform front, thus contributing to a scientific breakthrough that seeks to formulate explainable artificial intelligence (xai) models. xai is a machine learning field that inspects and tries to understand the models and steps involved in how the black box decisions of ai systems are made; it provides insights into the decision points, variables, and data used to make a recommendation. this study suggested that, to deploy explainable xai systems, ml models should be improved, making them interpretable and comprehensible.\",\"artificial intelligence and policy: quo vadis?. purpose: this paper aims to inform policymakers about key artificial intelligence (ai) technologies, risks and trends in national ai strategies. it suggests a framework of social governance to ensure emergence of safe and beneficial ai. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the paper is based on approximately 100 interviews with researchers, executives of traditional companies and startups and policymakers in seven countries. the interviews were carried out in january-august 2017. findings: policymakers still need to develop an informed, scientifically grounded and forward-looking view on what societies and businesses might expect from ai. there is lack of transparency on what key ai risks are and what might be regulatory approaches to handle them. there is no collaborative framework in place involving all important actors to decide on ai technology design principles and governance. today's technology decisions will have long-term consequences on lives of billions of people and competitiveness of millions of businesses. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the research did not include a lot of insights from the emerging markets. practical implications: policymakers will understand the scope of most important ai concepts, risks and national strategies. social implications: ai is progressing at a very fast rate, changing industries, businesses and approaches how companies learn, generate business insights, design products and communicate with their employees and customers. it has a big societal impact, as \\u2013 if not designed with care \\u2013 it can scale human bias, increase cybersecurity risk and lead to negative shifts in employment. like no other invention, it can tighten control by the few over the many, spread false information and propaganda and therewith shape the perception of people, communities and enterprises. originality\\u002fvalue: this paper is a compendium on the most important concepts of ai, bringing clarity into discussions around ai risks and the ways to mitigate them. the breadth of topics is valuable to policymakers, students, practitioners, general executives and board directors alike.\",\"hotel employee's artificial intelligence and robotics awareness and its impact on turnover intention: the moderating roles of perceived organizational support and competitive psychological climate. the advent of machines powered by artificial intelligence (ai) and robotics technologies have already strongly influenced the hospitality industry, and the effects of its replacement upon the human workforce has been a highly debated topic. despite this, empirical evidence in the form of published empirical studies have yet to appear in academic journals that present compelling evidence addressing what hospitality employees\\u2019 awareness of those potential impacts could be pertaining to ai and robotics specifically applied within the context of their turnover intention and future employment prospects. the purpose of this study was to present new empirical findings on this issue using data from a sample of 468 full-time five star hotel employees in guangzhou, china. ai and robotics awareness was found to be significantly associated with employee turnover intention. this relationship was moderated by perceived organizational support and competitive psychological climate. implications and directions for future research are provided.\",\"\\u201cthe reports of my death are greatly exaggerated\\u201d\\u2014artificial intelligence research in accounting. gray et al. (2014) examined the productivity of expert systems\\u002fartificial intelligence research in accounting and came to the conclusion that both research on and practice use of expert systems\\u002fartificial intelligence had waned since the late 1990s. in our study, we reconsider these findings based on a broader view that is \\u2018artificial intelligence\\u2019 centric versus \\u2018expert systems\\u2019 centric. the results show that while there was a bit of a lull in the late 1990s, artificial intelligence research in accounting has continued to steadily increase over the past 30 years. further consideration of artificial intelligence techniques as embedded modules in integrated audit support systems also suggest that use by practice continues to be robust. based on these findings, we make a call for much more research on the usability, and use, of artificial intelligence techniques in accounting domains. contrary to earlier perceptions, the research domain remains vibrant and holds great potential for ais researchers to take a leadership role in advancing the field.\",\"beyond design and use: how scholars should study intelligent technologies. this paper proposes a unified approach to studying intelligent technologies such as artificial intelligence (ai) that extends current studies of design and use. current discussion of the implication of ai and the future of work gloss four important issues: variation, power, ideology, and institutions. by a unified approach we mean a research agenda that coordinates studies of variation in use with research on power, ideology, design, and institutional change, all focused on a specific technology or set of technologies. the approach rests on the image of a technology timeline that begins with the issues of power and ideology that underwrite the promotion of intelligent technologies by firms and other stakeholders that have an interest in building and diffusing such technologies. moving to the right the timeline encompasses studies of design, implementation, and use that pay attention to variation in how intelligent technologies occasion changes in work and employment. finally, the unified approach extends beyond current workplace studies to consider the institutional changes that may arise as the result of how intelligent technologies are used and employs such considerations to shape the agenda of promoters and designers so that they will create technologies that better benefit society.\",\"metahuman systems = humans + machines that learn. metahuman systems are new, emergent, sociotechnical systems where machines that learn join human learning and create original systemic capabilities. metahuman systems will change many facets of the way we think about organizations and work. they will push information systems research in new directions that may involve a revision of the field\\u2019s research goals, methods and theorizing. information systems researchers can look beyond the capabilities and constraints of human learning toward hybrid human\\u002fmachine learning systems that exhibit major differences in scale, scope and speed. we review how these changes influence organization design and goals. we identify four organizational level generic functions critical to organize metahuman systems properly: delegating, monitoring, cultivating, and reflecting. we show how each function raises new research questions for the field. we conclude by noting that improved understanding of metahuman systems will primarily come from learning-by-doing as information systems scholars try out new forms of hybrid learning in multiple settings to generate novel, generalizable, impactful designs. such trials will result in improved understanding of metahuman systems. this need for large-scale experimentation will push many scholars out from their comfort zone, because it calls for the revitalization of action research programs that informed the first wave of socio-technical research at the dawn of automating work systems.\",\"cloud-based intelligent accounting applications: accounting task automation using ibm watson cognitive computing. this paper presents a cognitive computing model, based on artificial intelligence (ai) technologies, supporting task automation in the accounting industry. drivers and consequences of task automation, globally and in accounting, are reviewed. a framework supporting cognitive task automation is discussed. the paper recognizes essential differences between cognitive computing and data analytics. cognitive computing technologies that support task automation are incorporated into a model delivering federated knowledge. the impact of task automation on accounting job roles and the resulting creation of new accounting job roles supporting innovation are presented. the paper develops a hypothetical use case of building a cloud-based intelligent accounting application design, defined as cognitive services, using machine learning based on ai. the paper concludes by recognizing the significance of future research into task automation in accounting and suggests the federated knowledge model as a framework for future research into the process of digital transformation based on cognitive computing.\",\"strategic implications of openness in ai development. this paper attempts a preliminary analysis of the global desirability of different forms of openness in ai development (including openness about source code, science, data, safety techniques, capabilities, and goals). short-term impacts of increased openness appear mostly socially beneficial in expectation. the strategic implications of medium and long-term impacts are complex. the evaluation of long-term impacts, in particular, may depend on whether the objective is to benefit the present generation or to promote a time-neutral aggregate of well-being of future generations. some forms of openness are plausibly positive on both counts (openness about safety measures, openness about goals). others (openness about source code, science, and possibly capability) could lead to a tightening of the competitive situation around the time of the introduction of advanced ai, increasing the probability that winning the ai race is incompatible with using any safety method that incurs a delay or limits performance. we identify several key factors that must be taken into account by any well-founded opinion on the matter.\",\"are robots stealing our jobs?. the media and popular business press often invoke narratives that reflect widespread anxiety that robots may be rendering humans obsolete in the workplace. however, upon closer examination, many argue that automation, including robotics and artificial intelligence, is spreading unevenly throughout the labor market, such that middle-skill occupations that do not require a college degree are more likely to be affected adversely because they are easier to automate than high-skill occupations. in this article, the author examines the effect of industrial robots on occupations in the united states in 2010 and 2015. results from regression models indicate that an increase in industrial robots is associated with increases in high-skill and some middle-skill occupations but not for other types of occupations. these findings may indicate the ushering in of a new era in which robots are more technologically advanced and able to collaborate better with human employees.\",\"the rise of technological unemployment and its implications on the future macroeconomic landscape. recent technological advances in big data, machine learning, and robotics, have begun to have a negative influence on existing employment opportunities for human beings. numerous studies have demonstrated a worrisome decline in low- and medium-income employment resulting from the replacement of human workforce with machines. a seminal study by frey and osborne in 2013 predicted that 47% of the 702 examined occupations in the united states faced a high risk of decreased employment rate within the next 10\\u201325 years as a result of computerization. despite the seemingly dystopian future foreshadowed by these numbers, the wholesale replacement of labor by machines will most likely not become a reality in the foreseeable future for an array of reasons, including the creativity required by many occupations and interventions by governments. however, despite the barriers, computerization is likely to have a significant effect on the current market. in this paper, we aim to track the relative quantities of jobs that are either susceptible or non-susceptible to computerization in the future, by developing and utilizing an analytical model using markov chains. various simulations performed using this model demonstrate the importance of intervention policies, such as improved technical education of the public, in controlling the rate of computerization. moreover, the simulations identify the probable creation of new jobs that would facilitate new human employment. although radical changes in technology and economy await humanity, adequate preparation will help to facilitate a smoother transition into the age of computers.\",\"the rising tide of artificial intelligence and business automation: developing an ethical framework. recent advancements in robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and sensors now enable machines to automate activities that once seemed safe from disruption\\u2014including tasks that rely on higher-level thinking, learning, tacit judgment, emotion sensing, and even disease detection. despite these advancements, the ethical issues of business automation and artificial intelligence\\u2014and who will be affected and how\\u2014are less understood. in this article, we clarify and assess the cultural and ethical implications of business automation for stakeholders ranging from laborers to nations. we define business automation and introduce a novel framework that integrates stakeholder theory and social contracts theory. by integrating these theoretical models, our framework identifies the ethical implications of business automation, highlights best practices, offers recommendations, and uncovers areas for future research. our discussion invites firms, policymakers, and researchers to consider the ethical implications of business automation and artificial intelligence when approaching these burgeoning and potentially disruptive business practices.\",\"green artificial intelligence: towards an efficient, sustainable and equitable technology for smart cities and futures. smart cities and artificial intelligence (ai) are among the most popular discourses in urban policy circles. most attempts at using ai to improve efficiencies in cities have nevertheless ei-ther struggled or failed to accomplish the smart city transformation. this is mainly due to short-sighted, technologically determined and reductionist ai approaches being applied to complex urbanization problems. besides this, as smart cities are underpinned by our ability to engage with our environments, analyze them, and make efficient, sustainable and equitable decisions, the need for a green ai approach is intensified. this perspective paper, reflecting authors\\u2019 opinions and interpretations, concentrates on the \\u201cgreen ai\\u201d concept as an enabler of the smart city trans-formation, as it offers the opportunity to move away from purely technocentric efficiency solutions towards efficient, sustainable and equitable solutions capable of realizing the desired urban fu-tures. the aim of this perspective paper is two-fold: first, to highlight the fundamental shortfalls in mainstream ai system conceptualization and practice, and second, to advocate the need for a consolidated ai approach\\u2014i.e., green ai\\u2014to further support smart city transformation. the methodological approach includes a thorough appraisal of the current ai and smart city litera-tures, practices, developments, trends and applications. the paper informs authorities and plan-ners on the importance of the adoption and deployment of ai systems that address efficiency, sustainability and equity issues in cities.\",\"on the integration of agents and digital twins in healthcare. a digital twin is a digital representation of a physical asset reproducing its data model, its behaviour and its communication with other physical assets. digital twins act as a digital replica for the physical object or process they represent, providing nearly real-time monitoring and evaluation without being in close proximity. although most of their concrete applications can be found mainly in the industrial context, healthcare represents another relevant area where digital twins can have a disruptive impact. the main research question tackled by this paper is about the integration of digital twins with agents and multi-agent systems (mas) technologies in healthcare. after providing an overview of the application of digital twins in healthcare, in this paper, we discuss our vision about agent-based digital twins, and we present a first case study, about the application of agent-based digital twins to the management of severe traumas.\",\"impact of artificial intelligence on employees working in industry 4.0 led organizations. purpose: this study attempts to develop a practical understanding of the positive and negative employee experiences due to artificial intelligence (ai) adoption and the creation of technostress. it unravels the human resource development-related challenges with the onset of industry 4.0. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 professionals with average work experience of 7.6 years and working across nine industries, and the transcripts were analyzed using nvivo. findings: the findings establish prominent adverse impacts of the adoption of ai, namely, information security, data privacy, drastic changes resulting from digital transformations and job risk and insecurity brewing in the employee psyche. this is followed by a hierarchy of factors comprising the positive impacts, namely, work-related flexibility and autonomy, creativity and innovation and overall enhancement in job performance. further factors contributing to technostress (among employees): work overload, job insecurity and complexity were identified. practical implications: the emerging knowledge economy and technological interventions are changing the existing job profiles, hence the need for different skillsets and technological competencies. the organizations thus need to deploy strategic manpower development measures involving up-gradation of skills and knowledge management. inculcating requisite skills requires well-designed training programs using specialized tools and virtual reality (vr). in addition, employees need to be supported in their evolving socio-technical relationships, for managing both positive and negative outcomes. originality\\u002fvalue: this research makes the unique contribution of establishing a qualitative hierarchy of prominent factors constituting unintended consequences, positive impacts and technostress creators (among employees) of ai deployment in organizational processes.\",\"working algorithms: software automation and the future of work. while some argue that the rise of software automation threatens workers with obsolescence, others assert that new complementarities between humans and software systems are likely to emerge. this study draws on 19 months of participant-observation research at a software firm to investigate how relations between workers and technology evolved over three phases of the company\\u2019s development. the author finds two forms of human\\u2013software complementarity: computational labor that supports or stands in for software algorithms and emotional labor aimed at helping users adapt to software systems. instead of perfecting software algorithms that would progressively push people out of the production process, managers continually reconfigured assemblages of software and human helpers, developing new forms of organization with a dynamic relation to technology. the findings suggest how the dynamism of the organizations in which software algorithms are produced and implemented will contribute to labor\\u2019s enduring relevance in the digital age.\",\"active learning machine learns to create new quantum experiments. how useful can machine learning be in a quantum laboratory? here we raise the question of the potential of intelligent machines in the context of scientific research. a major motivation for the present work is the unknown reachability of various entanglement classes in quantum experiments. we investigate this question by using the projective simulation model, a physics-oriented approach to artificial intelligence. in our approach, the projective simulation system is challenged to design complex photonic quantum experiments that produce high-dimensional entangled multiphoton states, which are of high interest in modern quantum experiments. the artificial intelligence system learns to create a variety of entangled states and improves the efficiency of their realization. in the process, the system autonomously (re)discovers experimental techniques which are only now becoming standard in modern quantum optical experiments-a trait which was not explicitly demanded from the system but emerged through the process of learning. such features highlight the possibility that machines could have a significantly more creative role in future research.\",\"artificial intelligence in oil and gas upstream: trends, challenges, and scenarios for the future. we analyze how artificial intelligence changes a significant part of the energy sector, the oil and gas industry. we focus on the upstream segment as the most capital-intensive part of oil and gas and the segment of enormous uncertainties to tackle. basing on the analysis of ai application possibilities and the review of existing applications, we outline the most recent trends in developing ai-based tools and identify their effects on accelerating and de-risking processes in the industry. we investigate ai approaches and algorithms, as well as the role and availability of data in the segment. further, we discuss the main non-technical challenges that prevent the intensive application of artificial intelligence in the oil and gas industry, related to data, people, and new forms of collaboration. we also outline three possible scenarios of how artificial intelligence will develop in the oil and gas industry and how it may change it in the future (in 5, 10, and 20 years).\",\"revisiting the risk of automation. in light of rapid advances in the fields of artificial intelligence (ai) and robotics, many scientists discuss the potentials of new technologies to substitute for human labor. fueling the economic debate, various empirical assessments suggest that up to half of all jobs in western industrialized countries are at risk of automation in the next 10 to 20 years. this paper demonstrates that these scenarios are overestimating the share of automatable jobs by neglecting the substantial heterogeneity of tasks within occupations as well as the adaptability of jobs in the digital transformation. to demonstrate this, we use detailed task data and show that, when taking into accounting the spectrum of tasks within occupations, the automation risk of us jobs drops, ceteris paribus, from 38 % to 9 %.\",\"understanding the interplay of artificial intelligence and strategic management: four decades of research in review. as artificial intelligence (ai) is enabling the automation of many facets of management and is increasingly used in a wide range of strategic tasks, it is necessary to better understand its relevance for strategic management. however, research on the interplay of ai and strategic management is unbalanced and lacks a coherent structure due to its multidisciplinarity. this article contributes to the emerging academic discussion by systematically reviewing and categorizing the substantial amount of research that has been conducted since the first article in the field was published in 1979. furthermore, it introduces a comprehensive framework that integrates and synthesizes existing concepts. the framework displays the structure of the research field by classifying 58 relevant articles into two research scopes: condition-oriented research, which explores antecedents for leveraging the use of ai in strategic management, and outcome-oriented research, which studies the consequences of ai in strategic management at both the individual and the organizational level. given the exponential potential of ai to reshape the field in its current form and the need for a realistic assessment of its impact, this review proposes promising research avenues for studying the quantifiable effects of the interplay of ai and strategic management based on the developed framework.\",\"rethinking country effects: robotics, ai and work futures in norway and the uk. current debates around robotics and artificial intelligence (ai) are dominated by concerns over the threat to employment, amid widely varying estimates of potential job losses. countries are expected to fare differently, but there is little comparative research that goes beyond analysing industry and occupational structures. this article rethinks \\u2018country effects\\u2019 by exploring the role of institutions and social actors in shaping technological change in norway and the uk. drawing upon interviews with technology experts, employer associations and trade unions, it examines their perspectives on public policy support for the development and diffusion of robotics and ai, along with potential consequences for employment, work and skills. the research indicates significant country differences and the continued relevance of institutions, interests and power in analysing country effects.\",\"artificial intelligence and the public sector\\u2014applications and challenges. advances in artificial intelligence (ai) have attracted great attention from researchers and practitioners and have opened up a broad range of beneficial opportunities for ai usage in the public sector. against this background, there is an emerging need for a holistic understanding of the range and impact of ai-based applications and associated challenges. however, previous research considers ai applications and challenges only in isolation and fragmentarily. given the lack of a comprehensive overview of ai-based applications and challenges for the public sector, our conceptual approach analyzes and compiles relevant insights from scientific literature to provide an integrative overview of ai applications and related challenges. our results suggest 10 ai application areas, describing their value creation and functioning as well as specific public use cases. in addition, we identify four major dimensions of ai challenges. we finally discuss our findings, deriving implications for theory and practice and providing suggestions for future research.\",\"artificial intelligence in business: state of the art and future research agenda. this study provides an overview of state-of-the-art research on artificial intelligence in the business context and proposes an agenda for future research. first, by analyzing 404 relevant articles collected through web of science and scopus, this article presents the evolution of research on ai in business over time, highlighting seminal works in the field, and the leading publication venues. next, using a text-mining approach based on latent dirichlet allocation, latent topics were extracted from the literature and comprehensively analyzed. the findings reveal 18 topics classified into four main clusters: societal impact of ai, organizational impact of ai, ai systems, and ai methodologies. this study then presents several main developmental trends and the resulting challenges, including robots and automated systems, internet-of-things and ai integration, law, and ethics, among others. finally, a research agenda is proposed to guide the directions of future ai research in business addressing the identified trends and challenges.\",\"are we preparing for a good ai society? a bibliometric review and research agenda. artificial intelligence (ai) may be one of the most disruptive technologies of the 21st century, with the potential to transform every aspect of society. preparing for a \\u201cgood ai society\\u201d has become a hot topic, with growing public and scientific interest in the principles, policies, incentives, and ethical frameworks necessary for society to enjoy the benefits of ai while minimizing the risks associated with its use. however, despite the renewed interest in artificial intelligence, little is known of the direction in which ai scholarship is moving and whether the field is evolving towards the goal of building a \\u201cgood ai society\\u201d. based on a bibliometric analysis of 40147 documents retrieved from the web of science database, this study describes the intellectual, social, and conceptual structure of ai research. it provides 136 evidence-based research questions about how ai research can help understand the social changes brought about by ai and prepare for a \\u201cgood ai society.\\u201d the research agenda is organized according to ten social impact domains identified from the literature, including crisis response, economic empowerment, educational challenges, environmental challenges, equality and inclusion, health and hunger, information verification and validation, infrastructure management, public and social sector management, security, and justice.\",\"ai-enabled business models in legal services: from traditional law firms to next-generation law companies?. what will happen to law firms and the legal profession when the use of artificial intelligence (ai) becomes prevalent in legal services? we address this question by considering three related levels of analysis: tasks, business models, and organizations. first, we review ai's technical capabilities in relation to tasks, to identify contexts where it is likely to replace or augment humans. ai is capable of doing some, but not all, legal tasks better than lawyers and is augmented by multidisciplinary human inputs. second, we identify new business models for creating value in legal services by applying ai. these differ from law firms' traditional legal advisory business model, because they require technological (non-human) assets and multidisciplinary human inputs. third, we analyze the organizational structure that complements the old and new business models: the professional partnership (p2) is well-adapted to delivering the legal advisory business model, but the centralized management, access to outside capital, and employee incentives offered by the corporate form appear better to complement the new ai-enabled business models. some law firms are experimenting with pursuing new and old business models in parallel. however, differences in complements create conflicts when business models are combined. these conflicts are partially externalized via contracting and segregated and realigned via vertical integration. our analysis suggests that law firm experimentation with aligning different business models to distinct organizational entities, along with ethical concerns, will affect the extent to which the legal profession will become 'hybrid professionals'.\",\"introduction of artificial intelligence tools into the training methods of entrepreneurship activities. the current article focused on the scientific mission of increasing the level of training of entrepreneurial activities based on the usage of artificial intelligence tools. the study defined fuzzy models from the standpoint of cognitive understanding of information and development of the entrepreneurial training. there was developed the model of neuro-fuzzy regulator, as well as justified the technology of introduction of the neural network in business training. also, the study specified the m-machine concept for development of the artificial intelligence technology in provision of the entrepreneurial education.\",\"ethical governance is essential to building trust in robotics and artificial intelligence systems. this paper explores the question of ethical governance for robotics and artificial intelligence (ai) systems. we outline a roadmap-which links a number of elements, including ethics, standards, regulation, responsible research and innovation, and public engagement-as a framework to guide ethical governance in robotics and ai. we argue that ethical governance is essential to building public trust in robotics and ai, and conclude by proposing five pillars of good ethical governance. this article is part of the theme issue 'governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges'.\",\"artificial intelligence (ai): multidisciplinary perspectives on emerging challenges, opportunities, and agenda for research, practice and policy. as far back as the industrial revolution, significant development in technical innovation has succeeded in transforming numerous manual tasks and processes that had been in existence for decades where humans had reached the limits of physical capacity. artificial intelligence (ai) offers this same transformative potential for the augmentation and potential replacement of human tasks and activities within a wide range of industrial, intellectual and social applications. the pace of change for this new ai technological age is staggering, with new breakthroughs in algorithmic machine learning and autonomous decision-making, engendering new opportunities for continued innovation. the impact of ai could be significant, with industries ranging from: finance, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, supply chain, logistics and utilities, all potentially disrupted by the onset of ai technologies. the study brings together the collective insight from a number of leading expert contributors to highlight the significant opportunities, realistic assessment of impact, challenges and potential research agenda posed by the rapid emergence of ai within a number of domains: business and management, government, public sector, and science and technology. this research offers significant and timely insight to ai technology and its impact on the future of industry and society in general, whilst recognising the societal and industrial influence on pace and direction of ai development.\",\"responsible artificial intelligence as a secret ingredient for digital health: bibliometric analysis, insights, and research directions. with the unparallel advance of leading-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (ai), the healthcare systems are transforming and shifting for more digital health. in recent years, scientific productions have reached unprecedented levels. however, a holistic view of how ai is being used for digital health remains scarce. besides, there is a considerable lack of studies on responsible ai and ethical issues that identify and suggest practitioners\\u2019 essential insights towards the digital health domain. therefore, we aim to rely on a bibliometric approach to explore the dynamics of the interplay between ai and digital health approaches, considering the responsible ai and ethical aspects of scientific production over the years. we found four distinct periods in the publication dynamics and the most popular approaches of ai in the healthcare field. also, we highlighted the main trends and insightful directions for scholars and practitioners. in terms of contributions, this work provides a framework integrating ai technologies approaches and applications while discussing several barriers and benefits of ai-based health. in addition, five insightful propositions emerged as a result of the main findings. thus, this study\\u2019s originality is regarding the new framework and the propositions considering responsible ai and ethical issues on digital health.\",\"robots and jobs: evidence from us labor markets. we study the effects of industrial robots on us labor markets. we show theoretically that robots may reduce employment and wages and that their local impacts can be estimated using variation in exposure to robots-defined from industry-level advances in robotics and local industry employment. we estimate robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages across commuting zones. we also show that areas most exposed to robots after 1990 do not exhibit any differential trends before then, and robots\\u2019 impact is distinct from other capital and technologies. one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employmentto-population ratio by 0.2 percentage points and wages by 0.42%.\",\"artificial intelligence in service. artificial intelligence (ai) is increasingly reshaping service by performing various tasks, constituting a major source of innovation, yet threatening human jobs. we develop a theory of ai job replacement to address this double-edged impact. the theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks\\u2014mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic\\u2014and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. ai is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. the theory asserts that ai job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for \\u201clower\\u201d (easier for ai) intelligence tasks first. ai first replaces some of a service job\\u2019s tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job\\u2019s tasks. the progression of ai task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. an important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as ai takes over more analytical tasks, giving the \\u201csofter\\u201d intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. eventually, ai will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human\\u2013machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment.\",\"responsible innovation ecosystems: ethical implications of the application of the ecosystem concept to artificial intelligence. the concept of innovation ecosystems has become prominent due to its explanatory power. it offers a convincing account of innovation, explaining how and why innovation pathways change and evolve. it has been adopted to explain, predict, and steer innovation. the increasing importance of innovation for most aspects of human life calls for the inclusion of ethical and social rights aspects into the innovation ecosystems discourse. the current innovation ecosystems literature does not provide guidance on how the integration of ethical and social concerns into innovation ecosystems can be realised. one way to achieve this is to draw on the discussion of responsible research and innovation (rri). this paper applies rri to the innovation ecosystems discourse and proposes the concept of responsible innovation systems. it draws on the discussion of the ethics of artificial intelligence (ai) to explore how responsible ai innovation ecosystems can be shaped and realised.\",\"collaborative intelligence: how human and artificial intelligence create value along the b2b sales funnel. the b2b sales process is undergoing substantial transformations fueled by advances in information and communications technology, specifically in artificial intelligence (ai). the premise of ai is to turn vast amounts of data into information for superior knowledge creation and knowledge management in b2b sales. in doing so, ai can significantly alter the traditional human-centric sales process. in this article, we describe how ai affects the b2b sales funnel. for each stage of the funnel, we describe key sales tasks, explain the specific contributions ai can bring, and clarify the role humans play. we also outline managerial considerations to maximize the contributions from ai and people in the context of b2b sales.\",\"global evolution of research in artificial intelligence in health and medicine: a bibliometric study. the increasing application of artificial intelligence (ai) in health and medicine has attracted a great deal of research interest in recent decades. this study aims to provide a global and historical picture of research concerning ai in health and medicine. a total of 27, 451 papers that were published between 1977 and 2018 (84.6% were dated 2008-2018) were retrieved from the web of science platform. the descriptive analysis examined the publication volume, and authors and countries collaboration. a global network of authors\\u2019 keywords and content analysis of related scientific literature highlighted major techniques, including robotic, machine learning, artificial neural network, artificial intelligence, natural language process, and their most frequent applications in clinical prediction and treatment. the number of cancer-related publications was the highest, followed by heart diseases and stroke, vision impairment, alzheimer\\u2019s, and depression. moreover, the shortage in the research of ai application to some high burden diseases suggests future directions in ai research. this study offers a first and comprehensive picture of the global efforts directed towards this increasingly important and prolific field of research and suggests the development of global and national protocols and regulations on the justification and adaptation of medical ai products.\",\"artificial intelligence and entrepreneurship: implications for venture creation in the fourth industrial revolution. this article explores the ways artificial intelligence (ai) may impact new venture processes, practices and outcomes. we examine how such technology will augment and replace tasks associated with idea production, selling, and scaling. these changes entail new ways of working, and we consider implications for the organizational design of entrepreneurial ventures. while ai can enhance entrepreneurial activities, liabilities stem from this technological leverage. we advance a research agenda that draws attention towards negative social and economic implications of ai, particularly for more traditional small firms at risk of disintermediation in an ai economy.\",\"transition from factor-driven to innovation-driven urbanization in china: a study of manufacturing industry automation in dongguan city. following the reform and opening up of china, the pearl river delta (prd) region became a center of foreign investment due to its comparative advantages of cheap labor costs and low land use prices. the tide of migrant workers, comprising a large surplus rural labor force that flooded into the prd region, caused a rapid increase in the urban population. from the 1980s to the 2000s, migrant workers were a key force that drove urbanization in china. the utilization of automation technology in production since the 2010s has increased the number of unemployed laborers and shifted the dynamics of urbanization. this study investigated how automation is applied in production processes and its effects on different industries, namely, those related to textiles, electronic information, and home electrical appliance manufacturing; specifically we sought to examine the complex relationship among automation, the labor forces, and urbanization by illustrating the implementation of automation in production processes and its influence on labor forces and urbanization. this study revealed that companies in different industries implement automation to differing degrees and through varied upgrading paths. all industries can ultimately achieve technological transformation and cross-industry development. for labor forces, automation exerts two simultaneous folded effects, namely, the direct replacement of low- to middle-skilled workers and the creation of new jobs. the penetration of automation into manufacturing industries has changed the dynamics of urbanization and the social spatial structure of cities, leading to a polarization of the labor forces and the emergence of \\u201cdual cities\\u201d.\",\"artificial intelligence for decision support systems in the field of operations research: review and future scope of research. operations research (or) has been at the core of decision making since world war ii, and today, business interactions on different platforms have changed business dynamics, introducing a high degree of uncertainty. to have a sustainable vision of their business, firms need to have a suitable decision-making process at each stage, including minute details. our study reviews and investigates the existing research in the field of decision support systems (dsss) and how artificial intelligence (ai) capabilities have been integrated into or. the findings of our review show how ai has contributed to decision making in the operations research field. this review presents synergies, differences, and overlaps in ai, dsss, and or. furthermore, a clarification of the literature based on the approaches adopted to develop the dss is presented along with the underlying theories. the classification has been primarily divided into two categories, i.e. theory building and application-based approaches, along with taxonomies based on the ai, dss, and or areas. in this review, past studies were calibrated according to prognostic capability, exploitation of large data sets, number of factors considered, development of learning capability, and validation in the decision-making framework. this paper presents gaps and future research opportunities concerning prediction and learning, decision making and optimization in view of intelligent decision making in today\\u2019s era of uncertainty. the theoretical and managerial implications are set forth in the discussion section justifying the research questions.\",\"leveraging machine learning in the global fight against money laundering and terrorism financing: an affordances perspective. financial services organisations facilitate the movement of money worldwide, and keep records of their clients\\u2019 identity and financial behaviour. as such, they have been enlisted by governments worldwide to assist with the detection and prevention of money laundering, which is a key tool in the fight to reduce crime and create sustainable economic development, corresponding to goal 16 of the united nations sustainable development goals. in this paper, we investigate how the technical and contextual affordances of machine learning algorithms may enable these organisations to accomplish that task. we find that, due to the unavailability of high-quality, large training datasets regarding money laundering methods, there is limited scope for using supervised machine learning. conversely, it is possible to use reinforced machine learning and, to an extent, unsupervised learning, although only to model unusual financial behaviour, not actual money laundering.\",\"influences of artificial intelligence (ai) awareness on career competency and job burnout. purpose: the prevalence of artificial intelligence (ai) has considerably affected management and society. this paper aims to explore its potential impact on hospitality industry employees, bringing enlightenment to both employees and managers. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: data were collected from a survey of 432 employees who worked in full-service hotels in china. structural equation modeling (sem) was used to analyze the data. findings: results presented a positive relationship between ai awareness and job burnout. no significant direct relationship was found between ai awareness and career competencies. organizational commitment mediated the relationship between ai awareness and career competencies, as well as the relationship between ai awareness and job burnout. research limitations\\u002fimplications: this study contributes to human resource management in the hospitality industry to theoretical and practical aspects. theoretically, it enriched both career theory and fit theory. practically, this study reminds managers to pay attention to the adverse effect of ai on human capital. it also enlightens the manager to think of the positive effects that ai may bring. managers should provide proper support to overcome ai\\u2019s threat to human resources. practical implications: practically, this study reminds managers to pay attention to the adverse effect of ai on human capital. it also enlightens the manager to think of the positive effects that ai may bring. managers should provide proper support to overcome ai\\u2019s threat to human resources. originality\\u002fvalue: the study aims to analyze the impact of ai from a career perspective. it provided theoretical support and evidence for hotel managers for the effects of ai awareness on hotel employees. the study conveys a potential topic of concern that the hospitality industry may face in the future.\",\"artificial intelligence, robotics, advanced technologies and human resource management: a systematic review. although academic production in intelligent automation (e.g. artificial intelligence, robotics) has grown rapidly, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of the utilization of these technologies in human resource management (hrm) at an organizational (firms) and individual (employees) level. this study therefore aims to systematize the academic inputs on intelligent automation so far and to clarify what are its main contributions to and challenges for hrm. in a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top hrm, international business (ib), general management (gm) and information management (im) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within hrm settings. results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for hrm but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. the impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on hrm strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot\\u002fai collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and hrm activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance. this study discusses these shifts in detail, along with the main contributions to theory and practice and directions for future research.\",\"future of work in the digital world: preparing for instability and opportunity. despite conflicting forecasts about the pace and extent of technological changes that lie ahead, it is difficult to dispute the impact that advances in automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence have already had on work in the united states and globally. hirschi () provided an excellent discussion of these developments and what they may mean for career clients, practitioners, and researchers. the author aims to complement hirschi's contribution by (a) amplifying the nature of the challenges faced by workers, both currently and in the foreseeable future, and (b) considering steps that may be taken by career development experts, both individually and collectively, to meet these challenges. these steps include advocacy for displaced workers, participation in dialogues to transform educational institutions, and efforts to extend the range of counseling interventions to prepare clients for a career future that may be far less stable for increasing numbers of workers.\",\"leveraging artificial intelligence in business: implications, applications and methods. the concept of artificial intelligence (ai) as a business-disruptive technology has developed in academic and professional literature in a chaotic and unstructured manner. this study aims to provide clarity over the phenomenon of business activation of ai by means of a comprehensive and systematic literature review, aimed at suggesting a clear description of what artificial intelligence is today. the study analyses a corpus of 3780 contributions through an original combination of two established machine learning algorithms (lda and hierarchical clustering). the review produced a structured classification of the various streams of current research and a list of promising emerging trends. results have shed light on six topics attributable to three different themes, namely implications, applications and methods (iam model). our analysis could provide researchers and practitioners with a meaningful overview of the body of knowledge and research agenda, to exploit ai as an effective enabler to drive business value.\",\"data intelligence and analytics: a bibliometric analysis of human\\u2013artificial intelligence in public sector decision-making effectiveness. this study investigates the literary corpus of the role and potential of data intelligence and analytics through the lenses of artificial intelligence (ai), big data, and the human\\u2013ai interface to improve overall decision-making processes. it investigates how data intelligence and analytics improve decision-making processes in the public sector. a bibliometric analysis of a database containing 161 english-language articles published between 2017 and 2021 is performed, providing a map of the knowledge produced and disseminated in previous studies. it provides insights into key topics, citation patterns, publication activities, the status of collaborations between contributors over past studies, aggregated data intelligence, and analytics research contributions. the study provides a retrospective review of published content in the field of data intelligence and analytics. the findings indicate that field research has been concentrated mainly on emerging technologies' intelligence capabilities rather than on human\\u2013artificial intelligence in decision-making performance in the public sector. this study extends an ambidexterity theory in decision support, which enlightens how this ambidexterity can be encouraged and how it affects decision outcomes. the study emphasises the importance of the public sector adoption of data intelligence and analytics, as well as its efficiency. furthermore, this study expands how researchers and practitioners interpret and understand data intelligence and analytics, ai, and big data for effective public sector decision-making.\",\"from knowledge economy to automation anxiety: a growth regime in crisis?. in the 1990s, the \\u2018knowledge economy\\u2019 was hailed as a key driver of future prosperity by progressive policymakers in developed democracies. according to its proponents, in the knowledge economy, companies and countries alike would succeed by cultivating workers\\u2019 knowledge\\u2013as opposed to traditional forms of capital such as plant and machinery. this had radical implications for public policy, implying that education reform and other supply-side interventions could deliver inclusivity as well as prosperity. today, however, this benevolent vision of the social and economic impacts of technological progress has been superseded by an altogether more dystopian view, associated with automation and the rise of artificial intelligence, as well as transformations in the digital economy and the evolving nature of globalisation. this paper analyses that transition. it charts the key assumptions of the knowledge economy concept, through an intellectual history that focuses on how these ideas manifested themselves in the rhetoric of the uk government under tony blair. it then shows how evolving understandings of the digital economy, technological progress and globalisation challenge these assumptions, and the policy agenda that was premised on them.\",\"domain driven data mining in human resource management: a review of current research. an increasing number of publications concerning data mining in the subject of human resource management (hrm) indicate the presence of a prospering new research field. the current paper reviews this research on hr data mining to systematically uncover recent advancements and suggest areas for future work. based on the approach of domain driven data mining, an initial framework with significant domain-specific requirements is elaborated. relevant research contributions are identified and reviewed against the background of this framework. the review reveals that hrm constitutes a noteworthy new domain of data mining research that is dominated by method- and technology-oriented work. however, specific domain requirements, such as evaluating the domain success or complying with legal standards, are frequently not recognized or considered in current research. therefore, the systematic consideration of domain-specific requirements is demonstrated here to have significant implications for future research on data mining in hrm.\",\"assessing behavioral data science privacy issues in government artificial intelligence deployment. in today's global culture where the internet has established itself as the main tool for communication and commerce, the capability to massively analyze and predict citizens' behavior has become a priority for governments in terms of collective intelligence and security. at the same time, in the context of novel possibilities that artificial intelligence (ai) brings to governments in terms of understanding and developing collective behavior analysis, important concerns related to citizens' privacy have emerged. in order to identify the main uses that governments make of ai and to define citizens' concerns about their privacy, in the present study, we undertook a systematic review of the literature, conducted in-depth interviews, and applied data-mining techniques. based on our results, we classified and discussed the risks to citizens' privacy according to the types of ai strategies used by governments that may affect collective behavior and cause massive behavior modification. our results revealed 11 uses of ai strategies used by the government to improve their interaction with citizens, organizations in cities, services provided by public institutions or the economy, among other areas. in relation to citizens' privacy when ai is used by governments, we identified 8 topics related to human behavior predictions, intelligence decision making, decision automation, digital surveillance, data privacy law and regulation, and the risk of behavior modification. the paper concludes with a discussion of the development of regulations focused on the ethical design of citizen data collection, where implications for governments are presented aimed at regulating security, ethics, and data privacy. additionally, we propose a research agenda composed by 16 research questions to be investigated in further research.\",\"applied artificial intelligence and trust-the case of autonomous vehicles and medical assistance devices. automation with inherent artificial intelligence (ai) is increasingly emerging in diverse applications, for instance, autonomous vehicles and medical assistance devices. however, despite their growing use, there is still noticeable skepticism in society regarding these applications. drawing an analogy from human social interaction, the concept of trust provides a valid foundation for describing the relationship between humans and automation. accordingly, this paper explores how firms systematically foster trust regarding applied ai. based on empirical analysis using nine case studies in the transportation and medical technology industries, our study illustrates the dichotomous constitution of trust in applied ai. concretely, we emphasize the symbiosis of trust in the technology as well as in the innovating firm and its communication about the technology. in doing so, we provide tangible approaches to increase trust in the technology and illustrate the necessity of a democratic development process for applied ai.\",\"should we fear the robot revolution? (the correct answer is yes). advances in artificial intelligence and robotics may be leading to a new industrial revolution. this paper presents a model with the minimum necessary features to analyze the implications for inequality and output. two assumptions are key: \\u201crobot\\u201d capital is distinct from traditional capital in its degree of substitutability with human labor; and only capitalists and skilled workers save. we analyze a range of variants that reflect widely different views of how automation may transform the labor market. our main results are surprisingly robust: automation is good for growth and bad for equality; in the benchmark model real wages fall in the short run and eventually rise, but \\u201ceventually\\u201d can easily take generations.\",\"artificial intelligence in information systems research: a systematic literature review and research agenda. ai has received increased attention from the information systems (is) research community in recent years. there is, however, a growing concern that research on ai could experience a lack of cumulative building of knowledge, which has overshadowed is research previously. this study addresses this concern, by conducting a systematic literature review of ai research in is between 2005 and 2020. the search strategy resulted in 1877 studies, of which 98 were identified as primary studies and a synthesise of key themes that are pertinent to this study is presented. in doing so, this study makes important contributions, namely (i) an identification of the current reported business value and contributions of ai, (ii) research and practical implications on the use of ai and (iii) opportunities for future ai research in the form of a research agenda.\",\"applications of artificial intelligence in commercial banks \\u2013 a research agenda for behavioral finance. artificial intelligence (ai) is receiving increasing attention in business and society. in banking, the first applications of ai were successful; however, ai is mainly applied in investment banking and backend services without customer contact. ai in commercial banking with its focus on customer interaction has received little attention so far. introducing ai in commercial banking could change business processes and interactions with customers, which could create research opportunities for behavioral finance. based on this research gap, we conducted a structured literature review to identify applications of ai in commercial banks and the challenges of implementing ai. our findings suggest that by using ai, commercial banks can reduce losses in lending, increase security in processing payments, automate compliance-related work, and improve customer targeting. researchers worry about realizing technological advantages; the embedding of ai in business processes; ensuring user acceptance through transparency; privacy; and suitable documentation. finally, we propose a research agenda for behavioral finance.\",\"will algorithms blind people? the effect of explainable ai and decision-makers\\u2019 experience on ai-supported decision-making in government. computational artificial intelligence (ai) algorithms are increasingly used to support decision making by governments. yet algorithms often remain opaque to the decision makers and devoid of clear explanations for the decisions made. in this study, we used an experimental approach to compare decision making in three situations: humans making decisions (1) without any support of algorithms, (2) supported by business rules (br), and (3) supported by machine learning (ml). participants were asked to make the correct decisions given various scenarios, while br and ml algorithms could provide correct or incorrect suggestions to the decision maker. this enabled us to evaluate whether the participants were able to understand the limitations of br and ml. the experiment shows that algorithms help decision makers to make more correct decisions. the findings suggest that explainable ai combined with experience helps them detect incorrect suggestions made by algorithms. however, even experienced persons were not able to identify all mistakes. ensuring the ability to understand and traceback decisions are not sufficient for avoiding making incorrect decisions. the findings imply that algorithms should be adopted with care and that selecting the appropriate algorithms for supporting decisions and training of decision makers are key factors in increasing accountability and transparency.\",\"the role of artificial intelligence in healthcare: a structured literature review. background\\u002fintroduction: artificial intelligence (ai) in the healthcare sector is receiving attention from researchers and health professionals. few previous studies have investigated this topic from a multi-disciplinary perspective, including accounting, business and management, decision sciences and health professions. methods: the structured literature review with its reliable and replicable research protocol allowed the researchers to extract 288 peer-reviewed papers from scopus. the authors used qualitative and quantitative variables to analyse authors, journals, keywords, and collaboration networks among researchers. additionally, the paper benefited from the bibliometrix r software package. results: the investigation showed that the literature in this field is emerging. it focuses on health services management, predictive medicine, patient data and diagnostics, and clinical decision-making. the united states, china, and the united kingdom contributed the highest number of studies. keyword analysis revealed that ai can support physicians in making a diagnosis, predicting the spread of diseases and customising treatment paths. conclusions: the literature reveals several ai applications for health services and a stream of research that has not fully been covered. for instance, ai projects require skills and data quality awareness for data-intensive analysis and knowledge-based management. insights can help researchers and health professionals understand and address future research on ai in the healthcare field.\",\"the trainer, the verifier, the imitator: three ways in which human platform workers support artificial intelligence. this paper sheds light on the role of digital platform labour in the development of today\\u2019s artificial intelligence, predicated on data-intensive machine learning algorithms. focus is on the specific ways in which outsourcing of data tasks to myriad \\u2018micro-workers\\u2019, recruited and managed through specialized platforms, powers virtual assistants, self-driving vehicles and connected objects. using qualitative data from multiple sources, we show that micro-work performs a variety of functions, between three poles that we label, respectively, \\u2018artificial intelligence preparation\\u2019, \\u2018artificial intelligence verification\\u2019 and \\u2018artificial intelligence impersonation\\u2019. because of the wide scope of application of micro-work, it is a structural component of contemporary artificial intelligence production processes \\u2013 not an ephemeral form of support that may vanish once the technology reaches maturity stage. through the lens of micro-work, we prefigure the policy implications of a future in which data technologies do not replace human workforce but imply its marginalization and precariousness.\",\"a profession in transition: actors, tasks and roles in ai-based accounting. purpose: this article ties in with current debates on the digital transformation of society and the consequent work changes. using an artificial intelligence (ai)-based accounting context, the focus of this paper is on actors, roles and tasks and related skills on an individual level. the authors look at the effect of ai-based \\u201csmart\\u201d technology on the workforce in the broader accounting profession taking an intrafirm perspective, yet acknowledging that the digital transformation encompasses a much larger field in the financial sector. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the authors conduct a delphi study to identify the new roles and tasks in future accounting. in addition, the authors use expert workshops to clarify the related tasks and skills and determine whether either humans or ai-based technologies perform the roles or collaborate in professional accounting occupations. findings: the results show that tasks and skills for existing professional occupations in the broader acounting context will be subject to major changes in the next 10 years due to (ai based) digital technologies, while \\u201ccore\\u201d roles and tasks will continue to exist in the future, some will not be performed by humans but by ai-based technology. for other \\u201cnew\\u201d roles, humans will need to make informed use of digital technologies and, to some extent, collaborate with ai-based technology. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the authors look at the effect of ai-based \\u201csmart\\u201d technology on the workforce in the broader accounting profession, taking an intrafirm perspective. practical implications: this article ties in with current debates on the digital transformation of society and the consequent work changes. using an ai-based accounting context, the focus of this paper is on the new and adapted roles and tasks. originality\\u002fvalue: the comprehensive analysis based on the delphi study and expert workshops provide ample innovative ground for future research on the impact of ai on organisations and society.\",\"artificial intelligence: building blocks and an innovation typology. the range of topics and the opinions expressed on artificial intelligence (ai) are so broad that clarity is needed on the the field's central tenets, the opportunities ai presents, and the challenges it poses. to that end, we provide an overview of the six building blocks of artificial intelligence: structured data, unstructured data, preprocesses, main processes, a knowledge base, and value-added information outputs. we then develop a typology to serve as an analytic tool for managers grappling with ai's influence on their industries. the typology considers the effects of ai-enabled innovations on two dimensions: the innovations\\u2019 boundaries and their effects on organizational competencies. the typology's first dimension distinguishes between product-facing innovations, which influence a firm's offerings, and process-facing innovations, which influence a firm's operations. the typology's second dimension describes innovations as either competence-enhancing or competence-destroying; the former enhances current knowledge and skills, whereas the latter renders existing skills and knowledge obsolete. this framework lets managers evaluate their markets, the opportunities within them, and the threats arising from them, providing valuable background and structure to important strategic decisions.\",\"the impact of automation and artificial intelligence on worker well-being. discourse surrounding the future of work often treats technological substitution of workers as a cause for concern, but complementarity as a good. however, while automation and artificial intelligence may improve productivity or wages for those who remain employed, they may also have mixed or negative impacts on worker well-being. this study considers five hypothetical channels through which automation may impact worker well-being: influencing worker freedom, sense of meaning, cognitive load, external monitoring, and insecurity. we apply a measure of automation risk to a set of 402 occupations to assess whether automation predicts impacts on worker well-being along the dimensions of job satisfaction, stress, health, and insecurity. findings based on a 2002\\u20132018 dataset from the general social survey reveal that workers facing automation risk appear to experience less stress, but also worse health, and minimal or negative impacts on job satisfaction. these impacts are more concentrated on workers facing the highest levels of automation risk. this article encourages new research directions by revealing important heterogeneous effects of technological complementarity. we recommend that firms, policymakers, and researchers not conceive of technological complementarity as a uniform good, and instead direct more attention to mixed well-being impacts of automation and artificial intelligence on workers.\",\"the strategic impacts of intelligent automation for knowledge and service work: an interdisciplinary review. a significant recent technological development concerns the automation of knowledge and service work as a result of advances in artificial intelligence (ai) and its sub-fields. we use the term intelligent automation to describe this phenomenon. this development presents organisations with a new strategic opportunity to increase business value. however, academic research contributions that examine these developments are spread across a wide range of scholarly disciplines resulting in a lack of consensus regarding key findings and implications. we conduct the first interdisciplinary literature review that systematically characterises the intellectual state and development of intelligent automation technologies in the knowledge and service sectors. based on this review, we provide three significant contributions. first, we conceptualise intelligent automation and its associated technologies. second, we provide a business value-based model of intelligent automation for knowledge and service work and identify twelve research gaps that hinder a complete understanding of the business value realisation process. third, we provide a research agenda to address these gaps.\",\"collaborating with technology-based autonomous agents: issues and research opportunities. purpose: this article reports the results from a panel discussion held at the 2019 european conference on information systems (ecis) on the use of technology-based autonomous agents in collaborative work. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the panelists (drs izak benbasat, paul benjamin lowry, stefan morana, and stefan seidel) presented ideas related to affective and cognitive implications of using autonomous technology-based agents in terms of (1) emotional connection with these agents, (2) decision-making, and (3) knowledge and learning in settings with autonomous agents. these ideas provided the basis for a moderated panel discussion (the moderators were drs isabella seeber and lena waizenegger), during which the initial position statements were elaborated on and additional issues were raised. findings: through the discussion, a set of additional issues were identified. these issues related to (1) the design of autonomous technology-based agents in terms of human\\u2013machine workplace configurations, as well as transparency and explainability, and (2) the unintended consequences of using autonomous technology-based agents in terms of de-evolution of social interaction, prioritization of machine teammates, psychological health, and biased algorithms. originality\\u002fvalue: key issues related to the affective and cognitive implications of using autonomous technology-based agents, design issues, and unintended consequences highlight key contemporary research challenges that allow researchers in this area to leverage compelling questions that can guide further research in this field.\",\"failures of fairness in automation require a deeper understanding of human\\u2013ml augmentation. machine learning (ml) tools reduce the costs of performing repetitive, time-consuming tasks yet run the risk of introducing systematic unfairness into organizational processes. automated approaches to achieving fairness often fail in complex situations, leading some researchers to suggest that human augmentation of ml tools is necessary. however, our current understanding of human\\u2013ml augmentation remains limited. in this paper, we argue that the information systems (is) discipline needs a more sophisticated view of and research into human\\u2013ml augmentation. we introduce a typology of augmentation for fairness consisting of four quadrants: reactive oversight, proactive oversight, informed reliance, and supervised reliance. we identify significant intersections with previous is research and distinct managerial approaches to fairness for each quadrant. several potential research questions emerge from fundamental differences between ml tools trained on data and traditional is built with code. is researchers may discover that the differences of ml tools undermine some of the fundamental assumptions upon which classic is theories and concepts rest. ml may require massive rethinking of significant portions of the corpus of is research in light of these differences, representing an exciting frontier for research into human\\u2013ml augmentation in the years ahead that is researchers should embrace.\",\"how artificial intelligence affords digital innovation: a cross-case analysis of scandinavian companies. artificial intelligence (ai) is fuelling a new breed of digital innovation in human resource management by creating new opportunities for complying with general data protection regulation during data collection and analysis, decreasing biases, and offering targeted recommendations. however, ai is also posing challenges to organisations and key assumptions about digital innovation processes and outcomes, making it unclear how to combine ai affordances with actors, goals, and tasks. we conducted a qualitative multiple-case study in scandinavian organisations offering hr services. grounded theory guided our data collection and analysis. input-process-output framework and affordance theory supported the analysis of specific information processing constraints and enablers. we developed a framework to explain how ai affordances enable digital innovation and address the calls about definitional boundaries between innovation processes and outcomes. we showed how ai affordances are actualised and how this leads to reontologising decision-making and providing data driven legitimisation. our study contributes to digital innovation research by elucidating ai affordances and their actualisation in organisations. we conclude with the implications to theory and practice, limitations, and suggestions for future research.\",\"what do i do in a world of artificial intelligence? investigating the impact of substitutive decision-making ai systems on employees\\u2019 professional role identity. artificial intelligence (ai) systems in the workplace increasingly substitute for employees\\u2019 tasks, responsibilities, and decision-making. consequently, employees must relinquish core activities of their work processes without the ability to interact with the ai system (e.g., to influence decision-making processes or adapt or overrule decision-making outcomes). to deepen our understanding of how substitutive decision-making ai systems affect employees\\u2019 professional role identity and how employees adapt their identity in response to the system, we conducted an in-depth case study of a company in the area of loan consulting. we qualitatively analyzed more than 60 interviews with employees and managers. our research contributes to the literature on is and identity by disclosing mechanisms through which employees strengthen and protect their professional role identity despite being unable to directly interact with the ai system. further, we highlight the boundary conditions for introducing an ai system and contribute to the body of empirical research on the potential downsides of ai.\",\"artificial intelligence in tactical human resource management: a systematic literature review. digitization within human resource management (hrm) has resulted in artificial intelligence (ai) becoming increasingly prevalent in human resource management systems (hrms) and hr information systems (hris). the tactical procedures of recruitment, employee performance evaluation and satisfaction, compensation and benefit analysis, best practice analysis, discipline management, and employee training and development systems have seen a growth in the incorporation of ai. to better understand this evolution, we seek to explore publication sources and literature that feature the application of ai within hrm. by utilizing a systematic literature review methodology, this paper identifies which tactical hris (t-hris) components are featured in literature and how each t-hris component is represented. this paper gives insight to which component of tactical hrm\\u002fhris receives attention and identifies gaps in research to give direction to future research agendas.\",\"assessing whether artificial intelligence is an enabler or an inhibitor of sustainability at indicator level. since the early phase of the artificial-intelligence (ai) era expectations towards ai are high, with experts believing that ai paves the way for managing and handling various global challenges. however, the significant enabling and inhibiting influence of ai for sustainable development needs to be assessed carefully, given that the technology diffuses rapidly and affects millions of people worldwide on a day-to-day basis. to address this challenge, a panel discussion was organized by the kth royal institute of technology, the ai sustainability center and mit massachusetts institute of technology, gathering a wide range of ai experts. this paper summarizes the insights from the panel discussion around the following themes: the role of ai in achieving the sustainable development goals (sdgs); ai for a prosperous 21st century; transparency, automated decision-making processes, and personal profiling; and measuring the relevance of digitalization and artificial intelligence (d&ai) at the indicator level of sdgs. the research-backed panel discussion was dedicated to recognize and prioritize the agenda for addressing the pressing research gaps for academic research, funding bodies, professionals, as well as industry with an emphasis on the transportation sector. a common conclusion across these themes was the need to go beyond the development of ai in sectorial silos, so as to understand the impacts ai might have across societal, environmental, and economic outcomes. the recordings of the panel discussion can

address mass unemployment? sometimes productivity-enhancing technology increases industry employment instead. in manufacturing, jobs grew along with productivity for a century or more; only later did productivity gains bring declining employment. what changed? the elasticity of demand. using data over two centuries for us textile, steel and auto industries, this paper shows that automation initially spurred job growth because demand was highly elastic. but demand later became satiated, leading to job losses. a simple model explains why this pattern might be common, suggesting that today\\u2019s technologies may cause some industries to decline and others to grow. automation might not cause mass unemployment, but it may well require workers to make disruptive transitions to new industries, requiring new skills and occupations.\",\"performance analysis of machine learning based optimized feature selection approaches for breast cancer diagnosis. healthcare systems around the world are facing huge challenges in responding to trends of the rise of chronic diseases. the objective of our research study is the adaptation of data science and its approaches for prediction of various diseases in early stages. in this study we review latest proposed approaches with few limitations and their possible solutions for future work. this study also shows importance of finding significant features that improves results proposed by existing methodologies. this work aimed to build classification models such as na\\u00efve bayes, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, artificial neural network, adaboost, xgboost and gradient boosting. the experimental study chooses group of features by means of three feature selection approaches such as correlation-based selection, information gain based selection and sequential feature selection. various machine learning classifiers are applied on these feature subsets and based on their performance best feature subset is selected. finally, ensemble based max voting classifier is proposed on top of three best performing models. the proposed model produces an enhanced performance label with accuracy score of 99.41%.\",\"harnessing artificial intelligence capabilities to improve cybersecurity. cybersecurity is a fast-evolving discipline that is always in the news over the last decade, as the number of threats rises and cybercriminals constantly endeavor to stay a step ahead of law enforcement. over the years, although the original motives for carrying out cyberattacks largely remain unchanged, cybercriminals have become increasingly sophisticated with their techniques. traditional cybersecurity solutions are becoming inadequate at detecting and mitigating emerging cyberattacks. advances in cryptographic and artificial intelligence (ai) techniques (in particular, machine learning and deep learning) show promise in enabling cybersecurity experts to counter the ever-evolving threat posed by adversaries. here, we explore ai's potential in improving cybersecurity solutions, by identifying both its strengths and weaknesses. we also discuss future research opportunities associated with the development of ai techniques in the cybersecurity field across a range of application domains.\",\"discriminated by an algorithm: a systematic review of discrimination and fairness by algorithmic decision-making in the context of hr recruitment and hr development. algorithmic decision-making is becoming increasingly common as a new source of advice in hr recruitment and hr development. while firms implement algorithmic decision-making to save costs as well as increase efficiency and objectivity, algorithmic decision-making might also lead to the unfair treatment of certain groups of people, implicit discrimination, and perceived unfairness. current knowledge about the threats of unfairness and (implicit) discrimination by algorithmic decision-making is mostly unexplored in the human resource management context. our goal is to clarify the current state of research related to hr recruitment and hr development, identify research gaps, and provide crucial future research directions. based on a systematic review of 36 journal articles from 2014 to 2020, we present some applications of algorithmic decision-making and evaluate the possible pitfalls in these two essential hr functions. in doing this, we inform researchers and practitioners, offer important theoretical and practical implications, and suggest fruitful avenues for future research.\",\"artificial intelligence coaches for sales agents: caveats and solutions. firms are exploiting artificial intelligence (ai) coaches to provide training to sales agents and improve their job skills. the authors present several caveats associated with such practices based on a series of randomized field experiments. experiment 1 shows that the incremental benefit of the ai coach over human managers is heterogeneous across agents in an inverted-u shape: whereas middle-ranked agents improve their performance by the largest amount, both bottom- and top-ranked agents show limited incremental gains. this pattern is driven by a learning-based mechanism in which bottom-ranked agents encounter the most severe information overload problem with the ai versus human coach, while top-ranked agents hold the strongest aversion to the ai relative to a human coach. to alleviate the challenge faced by bottom-ranked agents, experiment 2 redesigns the ai coach by restricting the training feedback level and shows a significant improvement in agent performance. experiment 3 reveals that the ai\\u2013human coach assemblage outperforms either the ai or human coach alone. this assemblage can harness the hard data skills of the ai coach and soft interpersonal skills of human managers, solving both problems faced by bottom- and top-ranked agents. these findings offer novel insights into ai coaches for researchers and managers alike.\",\"industry 4.0 in finance: the impact of artificial intelligence (ai) on digital financial inclusion. this study sought to investigate the impact of ai on digital financial inclusion. digital financial inclusion is becoming central in the debate on how to ensure that people who are at the lower levels of the pyramid become financially active. fintech companies are using ai and its various applications to ensure that the goal of digital financial inclusion is realized that is to ensure that low-income earners, the poor, women, youths, small businesses participate in the mainstream financial market. this study used conceptual and documentary analysis of peer-reviewed journals, reports and other authoritative documents on ai and digital financial inclusion to assess the impact of ai on digital financial inclusion. the present study discovered that ai has a strong influence on digital financial inclusion in areas related to risk detection, measurement and management, addressing the problem of information asymmetry, availing customer support and helpdesk through chatbots and fraud detection and cybersecurity. therefore, it is recommended that financial institutions and non-financial institutions and governments across the world adopt and scale up the use of ai tools and applications as they present benefits in the quest to ensure that the vulnerable groups of people who are not financially active do participate in the formal financial market with minimum challenges and maximum benefits.\",\"intelligent human resource information system (i-hris): a holistic decision support framework for hr excellence. nowadays, human resource information system (hris) plays a strategic role in the decision making process for effective and efficient human resource management (hrm). for human resource (hr) decision making, most of the researchers propose expert systems or knowledge-based systems. unfortunately, there are some limitations in both of expert system and knowledge-based system. in this paper, we have proposed a framework of intelligent human resource information system (i-hris) applying intelligent decision support system (idss) along with knowledge discovery in database (kdd) to improve structured, especially semistructured and unstructured hr decision making process. moreover, the proposed hr idss stores and processes information with a set of artificial intelligent (ai) tools such as knowledge-based reasoning, machine learning and others. these ai tools are used to discover useful information or knowledge from past data and experience to support decision making process. we have likewise attempted to investigate idss applications for hr problems applying hybrid intelligent techniques such as machine learning and knowledge-based approach for new knowledge extraction and prediction. in summation, the proposed framework consists of input subsystems, decision making subsystems and output subsystems with ten hr application modules.\",\"ai-enabled recruiting: what is it and how should a manager use it?. ai-enabled recruiting systems have evolved from nice to talk about to necessary to utilize. in this article, we outline the reasons underlying this development. first, as competitive advantages have shifted from tangible to intangible assets, human capital has transitioned from supporting cast to a starring role. second, as digitalization has redesigned both the business and social landscapes, digital recruiting of human capital has moved from the periphery to center stage. third, recent and near-future advances in ai-enabled recruiting have improved recruiting efficiency to the point that managers ignore them or procrastinate their utilization at their own peril. in addition to explaining the forces that have pushed ai-enabled recruiting systems from nice to necessary, we outline the key strategic steps managers need to take in order to capture its main benefits.\",\"a systematic literature review on the impact of artificial intelligence on workplace outcomes: a multi-process perspective. artificial intelligence (ai) can bring both opportunities and challenges to human resource management (hrm). while scholars have been examining the impact of ai on workplace outcomes more closely over the past two decades, the literature falls short in providing a holistic scholarly review of this body of research. such a review is needed in order to: (a) guide future research on the effects of ai on the workplace; and (b) help managers make proper use of ai technology to improve workplace and organizational outcomes. this is the first systematic review to explore the relationship between artificial intelligence and workplace outcomes. through an exhaustive systematic review and analysis of existing literature, we ultimately examine and cross-relate 60 papers, published in 30 leading international (ajg 3 and 4) journals over a period of 25 years (1995\\u20132020). our review researches the ai-workplace outcomes nexus by drawing on the major functions of human resource management and the process framework of \\u2018antecedents, phenomenon, outcomes\\u2019 at multiple levels of analysis. we review the sampled articles based on years of publication, theories, methods, and key themes across the \\u2018antecedents, phenomenon, outcomes\\u2019 framework. we provide useful directions for future research by embedding our discussion within hr literature, while we recommend topics drawing on alternative units of analysis and theories that draw on the individual, team, and institutional levels.\",\"human-machine collaboration in managerial decision making. although artificial intelligence (ai) has become a pervasive organizational phenomenon, it is still unclear if and when people are willing to cooperate with machines. we conducted five empirical studies (total n = 1025 managers). the results show that human managers do not want to exclude machines entirely from managerial decisions, but instead prefer a partnership in which humans have a majority vote. across our studies, acceptance rates steadily increased up until the point where humans have approximately 70% weight and machines 30% weight in managerial decisions. after this point the curve flattened out, meaning that higher amounts of human involvement no longer increased acceptance. in addition to this overall pattern, we consistently found four classes of managers that reacted differently to different amounts of human versus machine involvement: a first class of managers (about 5%) preferred machines to have the upper hand, a second class of managers (about 15%) preferred an equal partnership between humans and machines, a third class of managers (about 50%) preferred humans to have the upper hand, and a final class of managers (about 30%) preferred humans to have complete control in managerial decisions. practical implications and directions for future research are discussed.\",\"enabling ai capabilities in government agencies: a study of determinants for european municipalities. artificial intelligence (ai) is gradually becoming an integral part of the digital strategy of organizations. yet, the use of ai in public organizations in still lagging significantly compared to private organizations. prior literature looking into aspects that facilitate adoption and use of ai has concentrated on challenges concerning technical aspects of ai technologies, providing little insight regarding the organizational deployment of ai, particularly in public organizations. building on this gap, this study seeks to examine what aspects enable public organizations to develop ai capabilities. to answer this question, we built an integrated and extended model from the technology-organization-environment framework (toe) and asked high-level technology managers from municipalities in europe about factors that influence their development of ai capabilities. we collected data from 91 municipalities from three european countries (i.e., germany, norway, and finland) and analyzed responses by means of structural equation modeling. our findings indicate that five factors \\u2013 i.e. perceived financial costs, organizational innovativeness, perceived governmental pressure, government incentives, regulatory support \\u2013 have an impact on the development of ai capabilities. we also find that perceived citizen pressure and perceived value of ai solutions are not important determinants of ai capability formation. our findings bear the potential to stimulate a more reflected adoption of ai supporting managers in public organizations to develop ai capabilities.\",\"understanding dark side of artificial intelligence (ai) integrated business analytics: assessing firm\\u2019s operational inefficiency and competitiveness. the data-centric revolution generally celebrates the proliferation of business analytics and ai in exploiting firm\\u2019s potential and success. however, there is a lack of research on how the unintended consequences of ai integrated business analytics (ai-ba) influence a firm\\u2019s overall competitive advantage. in this backdrop, this study aims to identify how factors, such as ai-ba opacity, suboptimal business decisions and perceived risk are responsible for a firm\\u2019s operational inefficiency and competitive disadvantage. drawing on the resource-based view, dynamic capability view, and contingency theory, the proposed research model captures the components and effects of an ai-ba opacity on a firm\\u2019s risk environment and negative performance. the data were gathered from 355 operational, mid-level and senior managers from various service sectors across all different size organisations in india. the results indicated that lack of governance, poor data quality, and inefficient training of key employees led to an ai-ba opacity. it then triggers suboptimal business decisions and higher perceived risk resulting in operational inefficiency. the findings show that operational inefficiency significantly contributes to negative sales growth and employees\\u2019 dissatisfaction, which result in a competitive disadvantage for a firm. the findings also highlight the significant moderating effect of contingency plan in the nomological chain.\",\"on the current state of combining human and artificial intelligence for strategic organizational decision making. strategic organizational decision making in today\\u2019s complex world is a dynamic process characterized by uncertainty. therefore, diverse groups of responsible employees deal with the large amount and variety of information, which must be acquired and interpreted correctly to deduce adequate alternatives. the technological potential of artificial intelligence (ai) is expected to offer further support, although research in this regard is still developing. however, as the technology is designed to have capabilities beyond those of traditional machines, the effects on the division of tasks and the definition of roles established in the current human\\u2013machine relationship are discussed with increasing awareness. based on a systematic literature review, combined with content analysis, this article provides an overview of the possibilities that current research identifies for integrating ai into organizational decision making under uncertainty. the findings are summarized in a conceptual model that first explains how humans can use ai for decision making under uncertainty and then identifies the challenges, pre-conditions, and consequences that must be considered. while research on organizational structures, the choice of ai application, and the possibilities of knowledge management is extensive, a clear recommendation for ethical frameworks, despite being defined as a crucial foundation, is missing. in addition, ai, other than traditional machines, can amplify problems inherent in the decision-making process rather than help to reduce them. as a result, the human responsibility increases, while the capabilities needed to use the technology differ from other machines, thus making education necessary. these findings make the study valuable for both researchers and practitioners.\",\"artificial intelligence in the industry 4.0, and its impact on poverty, innovation, infrastructure development, and the sustainable development goals: lessons from emerging economies?. artificial intelligence in the fourth industrial revolution is beginning to live up to its promises of delivering real value necessitated by the availability of relevant data, computational abil-ity, and algorithms. therefore, this study sought to investigate the influence of artificial intelligence on the attainment of sustainable development goals with a direct focus on poverty reduction, goal one, industry, innovation, and infrastructure development goal 9, in emerging economies. using content analysis, the result pointed to the fact that artificial intelligence has a strong influence on the attainment of sustainable development goals particularly on poverty reduction, improvement of the certainty and reliability of infrastructure like transport making economic growth and development possible in emerging economies. the results revealed that artificial intelligence is making poverty reduction possible through improving the collection of poverty-related data through poverty maps, revolutionizing agriculture education and the finance sector through financial inclusion. the study also discovered that ai is also assisting a lot in education, and the financial sector allowing the previously excluded individuals to be able to participate in the mainstream economy. therefore, it is important that governments in emerging economies need to invest more in the use of ai and increase the research related to it so that the sustainable development goals (sdgs) related to innovation, infrastructure development, poverty reduction are attained.\",\"does remote work flexibility enhance organization performance? moderating role of organization policy and top management support. with the advancement of information and communication technologies (icts), employees can work remotely without any hindrance. moreover, remote work provides organizations an option to remain operationally active during turbulent situations. remote work flexibility can be facilitated by the organizational top management team support. the objective of this study is to examine if remote work flexibility enhances organization performance, as few studies have explored this connection before. also, this study investigates the moderating role of top management team support and organization policy towards remote work flexibility. with the help of existing literature and theory, we have developed a model conceptually and then validated it using the pls-sem technique on data from 307 respondents. the study finds that remote work flexibility enhances organizational performance significantly, and organization policy and top management support play crucial roles in implementing organizations\\u2019 remote work policies.\",\"artificial intelligence and innovation management: a review, framework, and research agenda\\u2730. artificial intelligence (ai) reshapes companies and how innovation management is organized. consistent with rapid technological development and the replacement of human organization, ai may indeed compel management to rethink a company's entire innovation process. in response, we review and explore the implications for future innovation management. using ideas from the carnegie school and the behavioral theory of the firm, we review the implications for innovation management of ai technologies and machine learning-based ai systems. we outline a framework showing the extent to which ai can replace humans and explain what is important to consider in making the transformation to the digital organization of innovation. we conclude our study by exploring directions for future research.\",\"the impact of automation on employment: just the usual structural change?. we study the projected impact of automation on employment in the forthcoming decade, both at the macro-level and in actual (types of) sectors. hereto, we unite an evolutionary economic model of multisectoral structural change with labor economic theory. we thus get a comprehensive framework of how displacement of labor in sectors of application is compensated by intra- and intersectoral countervailing effects and notably mopped up by newly created, labor-intensive sectors. we use several reputable datasets with expert projections on employment in occupations affected by automation (and notably by the introduction of robotics and ai) to pinpoint which and how sectors and occupations face employment shifts. this reveals how potential job loss due to automation in \\\"applying\\\" sectors is counterbalanced by job creation in \\\"making\\\" sectors as well in complementary and quaternary, spillover sectors. finally, we study several macro-level scenarios on employment and find that mankind is facing \\\"the usual structural change\\\" rather than the \\\"end of work\\\". we provide recommendations on policy instruments that enhance the dynamic efficiency of structural change.\",\"artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and cognitive computing: what do these terms mean and how will they impact health care?. this article was presented at the 2017 annual meeting of the american association of hip and knee surgeons to introduce the members gathered as the audience to the concepts behind artificial intelligence (ai) and the applications that ai can have in the world of health care today. we discuss the origin of ai, progress to machine learning, and then discuss how the limits of machine learning lead data scientists to develop artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms through biomimicry. we will place all these technologies in the context of practical clinical examples and show how ai can act as a tool to support and amplify human cognitive functions for physicians delivering care to increasingly complex patients. the aim of this article is to provide the reader with a basic understanding of the fundamentals of ai. its purpose is to demystify this technology for practicing surgeons so they can better understand how and where to apply it.\",\"ai meets labor market: exploring the link between automation and skills. this paper develops a set of innovative tools for labor market intelligence by applying machine learning techniques to web vacancies on the italian labor market. our approach allows to calculate, for each occupation, the different types of skills required by the market alongside a set of relevant variables such as region, sector, education and level of experience. we construct a taxonomy for skills and map it into the recently developed esco classification system. we subsequently develop measures of the relevance of soft and hard skills and we analyze their detailed composition. we apply the dataset constructed to the debate on computerization of work. we show that soft and digital skills are related to the probability of automation of a given occupation and we shed some light on the complementarity\\u002fsubstitutability of hard and soft skills.\",\"micro-work, artificial intelligence and the automotive industry. this paper delves into the human factors in the \\u201cback-office\\u201d of artificial intelligence and of its data-intensive algorithmic underpinnings. we show that the production of ai is a labor-intensive process, which particularly needs the little-qualified, inconspicuous and low-paid contribution of \\u201cmicro-workers\\u201d who annotate, tag, label, correct and sort the data that help to train and test smart solutions. we illustrate these ideas in the high-profile case of the automotive industry, one of the largest clients of digital data-related micro-working services, notably for the development of autonomous and connected cars. this case demonstrates how micro-work has a place in long supply chains, where tech companies compete with more traditional industry players. our analysis indicates that the need for micro-work is not a transitory, but a structural one, bound to accompany the further development of the sector; and that its provision involves workers in different geographical and linguistic areas, requiring the joint study of multiple platforms operating at both global and local levels.\",\"designing, developing, and deploying artificial intelligence systems: lessons from and for the public sector. artificial intelligence applications in cognitive computing systems can be found in organizations across every market, including chatbots that help customers navigate websites, predictive analytics systems used for fraud detection, and augmented decision-support systems for knowledge workers. in this article, we share reflections and insights from our experience with ai projects in the public sector that can add value to any organization. we organized our findings into four thematic domains\\u2014(1) data, (2) technology, (3) organizational, and (4) environmental\\u2014and examine them relative to the phases of ai. we conclude with best practices for capturing value with cognitive computing systems.\",\"when machines think for us: the consequences for work and place. the relationship between technology and work, and concerns about the displacement effects of technology and the organisation of work, have a long history. the last decade has seen the proliferation of academic papers, consultancy reports and news articles about the possible effects of artificial intelligence (ai) on work-creating visions of both utopian and dystopian workplace futures. ai has the potential to transform the demand for labour, the nature of work and operational infrastructure by solving complex problems with high efficiency and speed. however, despite hundreds of reports and studies, ai remains an enigma, a newly emerging technology, and its rate of adoption and implications for the structure of work are still only beginning to be understood. the current anxiety about labour displacement anticipates the growth and direct use of ai. yet, in many ways, at present ai is likely being overestimated in terms of impact. still, an increasing body of research argues the consequences for work will be highly uneven and depend on a range of factors, including place, economic activity, business culture, education levels and gender, among others. we appraise the history and the blurry boundaries around the definitions of ai. we explore the debates around the extent of job augmentation, substitution, destruction and displacement by examining the empirical basis of claims, rather than mere projections. explorations of corporate reactions to the prospects of ai penetration, and the role of consultancies in prodding firms to embrace the technology, represent another perspective onto our inquiry. we conclude by exploring the impacts of ai changes in the quantity and quality of labour on a range of social, geographic and governmental outcomes.\",\"artificial intelligence for good health: a scoping review of the ethics literature. background: artificial intelligence (ai) has been described as the \\u201cfourth industrial revolution\\u201d with transformative and global implications, including in healthcare, public health, and global health. ai approaches hold promise for improving health systems worldwide, as well as individual and population health outcomes. while ai may have potential for advancing health equity within and between countries, we must consider the ethical implications of its deployment in order to mitigate its potential harms, particularly for the most vulnerable. this scoping review addresses the following question: what ethical issues have been identified in relation to ai in the field of health, including from a global health perspective? methods: eight electronic databases were searched for peer reviewed and grey literature published before april 2018 using the concepts of health, ethics, and ai, and their related terms. records were independently screened by two reviewers and were included if they reported on ai in relation to health and ethics and were written in the english language. data was charted on a piloted data charting form, and a descriptive and thematic analysis was performed. results: upon reviewing 12,722 articles, 103 met the predetermined inclusion criteria. the literature was primarily focused on the ethics of ai in health care, particularly on carer robots, diagnostics, and precision medicine, but was largely silent on ethics of ai in public and population health. the literature highlighted a number of common ethical concerns related to privacy, trust, accountability and responsibility, and bias. largely missing from the literature was the ethics of ai in global health, particularly in the context of low- and middle-income countries (lmics). conclusions: the ethical issues surrounding ai in the field of health are both vast and complex. while ai holds the potential to improve health and health systems, our analysis suggests that its introduction should be approached with cautious optimism. the dearth of literature on the ethics of ai within lmics, as well as in public health, also points to a critical need for further research into the ethical implications of ai within both global and public health, to ensure that its development and implementation is ethical for everyone, everywhere.\",\"partnering with al: how organizations can win over skeptical managers. the emergence of artificial intelligence (ai) promises to transform the nature of work and the relationship among human beings and machines in organizations. managers must learn to deal with this coming upheaval because ai will significantly modify how they and those that report to them perform their work. and, their organizations will need them to help in navigating the largest transformation in the workplace since the industrial revolution.[1] nevertheless, our research reveals that managers are not quite on the same page when it comes to ai. their readiness and enthusiasm for ai vary extensively across organizational levels and geographies \\u2013 raising serious questions about how organizations can best adopt ai and get the most business value from it. consequently, we believe that ai adoption requires adaptation where executives help managers adjust to new, intelligent technologies. executives should involve managers from different levels and geographies in initial experimentation with and implementation of ai in the organization. greater involvement will allow managers to familiarize themselves with skills and potential solutions driven by ai and human input. as an extension of this strategy, the quality of work performed by intelligent machines will benefit \\u2013 training in context, learning from the actions and patterns of managers who will eventually work with such systems on a regular basis.\",\"a nurse-driven method for developing artificial intelligence in \\u201csmart\\u201d homes for aging-in-place. objectives: to offer practical guidance to nurse investigators interested in multidisciplinary research that includes assisting in the development of artificial intelligence (ai) algorithms for \\u201csmart\\u201d health management and aging-in-place. methods: ten health-assistive smart homes were deployed to chronically ill older adults from 2015 to 2018. data were collected using five sensor types (infrared motion, contact, light, temperature, and humidity). nurses used telehealth and home visitation to collect health data and provide ground truth annotation for training intelligent algorithms using raw sensor data containing health events. findings: nurses assisting with the development of health-assistive ai may encounter unique challenges and opportunities. we recommend: (a) using a practical and consistent method for collecting field data, (b) using nurse-driven measures for data analytics, (c) multidisciplinary communication occur on an engineering-preferred platform. conclusions: practical frameworks to guide nurse investigators integrating clinical data with sensor data for training machine learning algorithms may build capacity for nurses to make significant contributions to developing ai for health-assistive smart homes.\",\"using large-scale experiments and machine learning to discover theories of human decision-making. predicting and understanding how people make decisions has been a long-standing goal in many fields, with quantitative models of human decision-making informing research in both the social sciences and engineering. we show how progress toward this goal can be accelerated by using large datasets to power machine-learning algorithms that are constrained to produce interpretable psychological theories. conducting the largest experiment on risky choice to date and analyzing the results using gradient-based optimization of differentiable decision theories implemented through artificial neural networks, we were able to recapitulate historical discoveries, establish that there is room to improve on existing theories, and discover a new, more accurate model of human decision-making in a form that preserves the insights from centuries of research.\",\"what influences algorithmic decision-making? a systematic literature review on algorithm aversion. with the continuing application of artificial intelligence (ai) technologies in decision-making, algorithmic decision-making is becoming more efficient, often even outperforming humans. despite this superior performance, people often consciously or unconsciously display reluctance to rely on algorithms, a phenomenon known as algorithm aversion. viewed as a behavioral anomaly, algorithm aversion has recently attracted much scholarly attention. with a view to synthesize the findings of existing literature, we systematically review 80 empirical studies identified through searching in seven academic databases and using the snowballing technique. we inductively categorize the influencing factors of algorithm aversion under four main themes: algorithm, individual, task, and high-level. our analysis reveals that although algorithm and individual factors have been investigated extensively, very little attention has been given to exploring the task and high-level factors. we contribute to algorithm aversion literature by proposing a comprehensive framework, highlighting open issues in existing studies, and outlining several research avenues that could be handled in future research. our model could guide developers in designing and developing and managers in implementing and using of algorithmic decision.\",\"deep convolutional framework for abnormal behavior detection in a smart surveillance system. the ability to instantly detect risky behavior in video surveillance systems is a critical issue in a smart surveillance system. in this paper, a unified framework based on a deep convolutional framework is proposed to detect abnormal human behavior from a standard rgb image. the objective of the unified structure is to improve detection speed while maintaining recognition accuracy. the deep convolutional framework consists of (1) a human subject detection and discrimination module that is proposed to solve the problem of separating object entities, in contrast to previous object detection algorithms, (2) a posture classification module to extract spatial features of abnormal behavior, and (3) an abnormal behavior detection module based on long short-term memory (lstm). experiments on a benchmark dataset evaluate the potential of the proposed method in the context of smart surveillance. the results indicate that the proposed method provides satisfactory performance in detecting abnormal behavior in a real-world scenario.\",\"how intelligent is watson? enabling digital transformation through artificial intelligence. due to its intrinsic characteristics, artificial intelligence (ai) can be considered a general-purpose technology (gpt) in the digital era. most studies in the field focus on the ex-post recognition and classification of gpt but in this article, we look at a gpt design ex-ante by reviewing the extreme and inspiring example of ibm's watson. our objective is to shed light on how companies can create value through ai. in particular, our longitudinal case study highlights the strategic decisions ibm took to create value in two dimensions: internal development and external collaborations. we offer relevant implications for practitioners and academics eager to know more about ai in the digital world.\",\"ai-employee collaboration and business performance: integrating knowledge-based view, socio-technical systems and organisational socialisation framework. the extant literature has outlined the significance of collaborative intelligence stemming from effective partnership between artificial intelligence (ai) systems and human workers to achieve organisationally valued outcomes. however, there is paucity of research insights on the factors influencing ai-human partnership and its impact on business performance. to bridge this knowledge gap, this paper draws on the knowledge-based view, (kbv) socio-technical systems (sts) and organisational socialisation framework (osf) to develop and validate a novel theoretical model examining the relationships between knowledge sharing, employees\\u2019 ai skills, trust, and role clarity in a collaborative working environment to enhance business performance. a primary survey-based research method was used to capture responses from 164 employees in the uk creative industries, and further analysed by employing structural equation modelling technique. our findings will provide managers and the ai community with primary evidence and strategies that will help to develop collaborative intelligence capabilities within the organisations.\",\"hybrid collective intelligence in a human\\u2013ai society. within current debates about the future impact of artificial intelligence (ai) on human society, roughly three different perspectives can be recognised: (1) the technology-centric perspective, claiming that ai will soon outperform humankind in all areas, and that the primary threat for humankind is superintelligence; (2) the human-centric perspective, claiming that humans will always remain superior to ai when it comes to social and societal aspects, and that the main threat of ai is that humankind\\u2019s social nature is overlooked in technological designs; and (3) the collective intelligence-centric perspective, claiming that true intelligence lies in the collective of intelligent agents, both human and artificial, and that the main threat for humankind is that technological designs create problems at the collective, systemic level that are hard to oversee and control. the current paper offers the following contributions: (a) a clear description for each of the three perspectives, along with their history and background; (b) an analysis and interpretation of current applications of ai in human society according to each of the three perspectives, thereby disentangling miscommunication in the debate concerning threats of ai; and (c) a new integrated and comprehensive research design framework that addresses all aspects of the above three perspectives, and includes principles that support developers to reflect and anticipate upon potential effects of ai in society.\",\"research priorities for robust and beneficial artificial intelligence. success in the quest for artificial intelligence has the potential to bring unprecedented benefits to humanity, and it is therefore worthwhile to investigate how to maximize these benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls. this article gives numerous examples (which should by no means be construed as an exhaustive list) of such worthwhile research aimed at ensuring that ai remains robust and beneficial.\",\"artificial intelligence: scope, players, markets and geography. purpose: this paper aims to clarify the notion of artificial intelligence (ai), reviewing the present scope of the phenomenon through its main applications. it aims at describing the various applications while assessing the markets, highlighting some of the leading industrial sectors in the field. therefore, it identifies pioneering companies and the geographical distribution of ai companies. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the paper builds upon an in-depth investigation of public initiatives focusing mostly on the eu. it is based on desk research, a comprehensive review of the main grey and scientific literature in this field. findings: the paper notes that there is no real consensus on any definition for this umbrella term, that the definition does fluctuate over time but highlights some of the main changes and advances that took place over the past 60 years. it stresses that, in spite of the hype, on both the business and consumer sides, the demand appears uncertain. the scope of the announced disruptions is not easy to assess, technological innovation associated with ai may be modest or take some time to be fully deployed. however, some companies and regions are leading already in the field. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the paper, based on desk research, does not consider any expert opinions. besides, the scientific literature on the phenomenon is still scarce (but not the technical one in the specific research sectors of ai). most of the data come from consultancies or government publications which may introduce some bias, although the paper gathered various, often conflicting viewpoints. originality\\u002fvalue: the paper gives a thorough review of the available literature (consultancies, governments) stressing the limitations of the available research on economic and social aspects. it aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the major trends in the field. it gives a global overview of companies and regions.\",\"artificial intelligence and business value: a literature review. artificial intelligence (ai) are a wide-ranging set of technologies that promise several advantages for organizations in terms off added business value. over the past few years, organizations are increasingly turning to ai in order to gain business value following a deluge of data and a strong increase in computational capacity. nevertheless, organizations are still struggling to adopt and leverage ai in their operations. the lack of a coherent understanding of how ai technologies create business value, and what type of business value is expected, therefore necessitates a holistic understanding. this study provides a systematic literature review that attempts to explain how organizations can leverage ai technologies in their operations and elucidate the value-generating mechanisms. our analysis synthesizes the current literature and highlights: (1) the key enablers and inhibitors of ai adoption and use; (2) the typologies of ai use in the organizational setting; and (3) the first- and second-order effects of ai. the paper concludes with an identification of the gaps in the literature and develops a research agenda that identifies areas that need to be addressed by future studies.\",\"innovation ecosystems theory revisited: the case of artificial intelligence in china. beyond the mainstream discussion on the key role of china in the global ai landscape, the knowledge about the real performance and future perspectives of the ai ecosystem in china is still limited. this paper evaluates the status and prospects of china's ai innovation ecosystem by developing a triple helix framework particularized for this case. based on an in-depth qualitative study and on interviews with experts, the analysis section summarizes the way in which the ai innovation ecosystem in china is being built, which are the key features of the three spheres of the triple helix -governments, industry and academic\\u002fresearch institutions-as well as the dynamic context of the ecosystem through the identification of main aspects related to the flows of skills, knowledge and funding and the interactions among them. using this approach, the discussion section illustrates the specificities of the ai innovation ecosystem in china, its strengths and its gaps, and which are its prospects. overall, this revisited ecosystem approach permits the authors to address the complexity of emerging environments of innovation to draw meaningful conclusions which are not possible with mere observation. the results show how a favourable context, the broad adoption rate and the competition for talent and capital among regional-specialized clusters are boosting the advance of ai in china, mainly in the business to customer arena. finally, the paper highlights the challenges ahead in the current implementation of the ecosystem that will largely determine the potential global leadership of china in this domain.\",\"development and validation of an artificial intelligence anxiety scale: an initial application in predicting motivated learning behavior. while increasing productivity and economic growth, the application of artificial intelligence (ai) may ultimately require millions of people around the world to change careers or improve their skills. these disruptive effects contribute to the general public anxiety toward ai development. despite the rising levels of ai anxiety (aia) in recent decades, no ai anxiety scale (aias) has been developed. given the limited utility of existing self-report instruments in measuring aia, the aim of this paper is to develop a standardized tool to measure this phenomenon. specifically, this paper introduces and defines the construct of aia, develops a generic aias, and discusses the theoretical and practical applications of the instrument. the procedures used to conceptualize the survey, create the measurement items, collect data, and validate the multi-item scale are described. by analyzing data obtained from a sample of 301 respondents, the reliability, criterion-related validity, content validity, discriminant validity, convergent validity, and nomological validity of the constructs and relationships are fully examined. overall, this empirically validated instrument advances scholarly knowledge regarding aia and its associated behaviors.\",\"when the machine meets the expert: an ethnography of developing ai for hiring. the introduction of machine learning (ml) in organizations comes with the claim that algorithms will produce insights superior to those of experts by discovering the \\u201ctruth\\u201d from data. such a claim gives rise to a tension between the need to produce knowledge independent of domain experts and the need to remain relevant to the domain the system serves. this two-year ethnographic study focuses on how developers managed this tension when building an ml system to support the process of hiring job candidates at a large international organization. despite the initial goal of getting domain experts \\u201cout the loop,\\u201d we found that developers and experts arrived at a new hybrid practice that relied on a combination of ml and domain expertise. we explain this outcome as resulting from a process of mutual learning in which deep engagement with the technology triggered actors to reflect on how they produced knowledge. these reflections prompted the developers to iterate between excluding domain expertise from the ml system and including it. contrary to common views that imply an opposition between ml and domain expertise, our study foregrounds their interdependence and as such shows the dialectic nature of developing ml. we discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for the literature on information technologies and knowledge work, information system development and implementation, and human\\u2013ml hybrids.\",\"the automation of leadership functions: would people trust decision algorithms?. the advancing maturity of algorithm-based decision-making enables computers to perform many leadership functions today. however, a central precondition of successful implementation should be that human workers trust such automated leadership agents. the present study (n = 333 workers) compared participants\\u2019 reactions towards automated and human leadership using experimental vignette methodology with hypothetical work scenarios. we manipulated type of leadership agent (human vs. computer) and decision subject (disciplinary vs. mentoring), and measured participants\\u2019 trustworthiness perceptions and trust in the leadership agent. results showed that participants perceived automated leadership agents as being higher on integrity and transparency than human leadership agents. however, human leadership agents were perceived as more adaptable and more benevolent. no differences occurred with respect to perceived data processing capacity or as a function of decision subject. perceived trustworthiness predicted trust in the leadership agent, which in turn was positively related to further work-related outcomes (e.g., perceived fairness of the decision, perceived organizational support), confirming the general relevance of trust for organizations. the results contribute to our understanding of trust in automated leadership and offer practical implications for computer-based decision-making in the leadership context.\",\"rebooting employees: upskilling for artificial intelligence in multinational corporations. proponents of artificial intelligence (ai) have envisaged a scenario wherein intelligent machines would execute routine tasks performed by humans, thus, relieving them to engage in creative pursuits. while there is widespread fear of corresponding job losses, organizational think tanks vouch for the synergistic culmination of human\\u2013machine competencies. using the dynamic skill, neo-human capital and ai job replacement theories, we contend that the introduction and adoption of ai calls for employees to upskill themselves. to determine the key skills deemed critical for the upskilling of employees, we interviewed 20 experienced professionals in multinational corporations (mncs) in the information technology sector in india. deploying gioia\\u2019s methodology for qualitative analysis, our investigation revealed five critical skills for employee upskilling: data analysis, digital, complex cognitive, decision making and continuous learning skills.\",\"artificial intelligence and the future of work: human-ai symbiosis in organizational decision making. artificial intelligence (ai) has penetrated many organizational processes, resulting in a growing fear that smart machines will soon replace many humans in decision making. to provide a more proactive and pragmatic perspective, this article highlights the complementarity of humans and ai and examines how each can bring their own strength in organizational decision-making processes typically characterized by uncertainty, complexity, and equivocality. with a greater computational information processing capacity and an analytical approach, ai can extend humans\\u2019 cognition when addressing complexity, whereas humans can still offer a more holistic, intuitive approach in dealing with uncertainty and equivocality in organizational decision making. this premise mirrors the idea of intelligence augmentation, which states that ai systems should be designed with the intention of augmenting, not replacing, human contributions.\",\"artificial intelligence as augmenting automation: implications for employment. there has been concern that artificial intelligence (ai) may cause significant unemployment; however, proponents say that ai augments jobs. both of these positions have substance, but there is a need to articulate the mechanisms by which ai may actually do both, and, in the process, transform the balance of work available. we examine economic studies of automation\\u2019s impact on employment and skills, illustrating the favoring of nonroutine skills over the routine, and a hollowing-out of middle-skill jobs. we then use case evidence of ai and automation to show how ai is augmenting automation to the same effect, allowing firms to modularize and control routine work. the remaining work tends to be nonroutine and low-skilled (allowing for further replacement in the future), or high-skilled. we illustrate the dynamic effects that occur when ai is combined with other key technologies, creating economies of scale and scope for firms. through augmentation, the resulting employment structures may also have lower quantities of high-skilled work. this depends on advances in ai, and its ability to replace more complex forms of work. we end with a call for more critical conversations between society and business, and on what business schools should teach.

the context of the 4th industrial revolution, artificial intelligence (ai) and environmental challenges, this study investigates the role of ai, robotics stocks and green bonds in portfolio diversification. using daily data from 2017 to 2020, we employ tail dependence as copulas and the generalized forecast error variance decomposition to examine the volatility connectedness. our results suggest that, first, portfolios consisting of these assets exhibit heavy-tail dependence which implies that in the times of economic turbulence, there will be a high probability of large joint losses. second, volatility transmission is higher in the short term, implying that short-term shocks can cause higher volatility in the assets, but in the long run, volatility transmission decreases. third, bitcoin and gold are vital assets for hedging, though the bitcoin is also affected by its past volatility, a feature it shares with green bonds and nasdaq ai. during economic downturns, gold may act as a safe haven, as its shock transmission to nasdaq ai is just around 1.41%. lastly, the total volatility transmission of all financial assets is considerably high, suggesting that the portfolio has an inherent self-transmitting risk which requires careful diversification. the nasdaq ai and general equity indexes are not good hedging instruments for each other.\",\"will covid-19 be the tipping point for the intelligent automation of work? a review of the debate and implications for research. as part of the urgent need to respond to the covid-19 pandemic, governments, healthcare providers, and businesses have looked to applications of artificial intelligence (ai) to compensate for the unavailability of human workers. this interest has renewed the debate regarding the use of ai for the automation of work, which has been described as intelligent automation (ia). a new dimension to this debate is whether covid-19 will be the catalyst for higher ia adoption levels. this article reviews arguments in favour of covid-19 increasing the level of ia adoption and possible counter-arguments. key arguments in favour of increased ia adoption include consumer preferences changing to favour ia, increasing familiarity of ia technologies, and increased business confidence in ia. counter-arguments include big data availability and reliability limitations, many tasks still favouring human skills over ia, the narrow capabilities of ia technologies, and a high availability of human workers. the article also discusses the implications of this debate for information management research and practice.\",\"\\u201cyou\\u2019re fired,\\u201d says the robot: the rise of automation in the workplace, technophobes, and fears of unemployment. the rapid adoption of new technologies in the workplace, especially robotics and artificial intelligence (ai), has motivated some researchers to determine what effects such technologies may have. few scholars, however, have examined the possibility that a large segment of the population is apprehensive about the quick pace of technological change and encroachment into modern life. drawing from economic projections about the future of the digital economy and from literature in the sociology of technology and emotions, this article explores whether certain fears of technology exacerbate fears of unemployment and financial insecurity. using data from wave 2 of the chapman survey of american fears (n = 1,541), i find that there exists a sizable population of \\u201ctechnophobes\\u201d or those who fear robots, ai, and technology they do not understand. technophobes are also more likely than nontechnophobes to report having anxiety-related mental health issues and to fear unemployment and financial insecurity. with advances in robotics and ai, the threat of technological unemployment is discussed as a real concern among a substantial portion of the american population.\",\"algorithmic decision-making? the user interface and its role for human involvement in decisions supported by artificial intelligence. artificial intelligence can provide organizations with prescriptive options for decision-making. based on the notions of algorithmic decision-making and user involvement, we assess the role of artificial intelligence in workplace decisions. using a case study on the implementation and use of cognitive software in a telecommunications company, we address how actors can become distanced from or remain involved in decision-making. our results show that humans are increasingly detached from decision-making spatially as well as temporally and in terms of rational distancing and cognitive displacement. at the same time, they remain attached to decision-making because of accidental and infrastructural proximity, imposed engagement, and affective adhesion. when human and algorithmic intelligence become unbalanced in regard to humans\\u2019 attachment to decision-making, three performative effects result: deferred decisions, workarounds, and (data) manipulations. we conceptualize the user interface that presents decisions to humans as a mediator between human detachment and attachment and, thus, between algorithmic and humans\\u2019 decisions. these findings contrast the traditional view of automated media as diminishing user involvement and have useful implications for research on artificial intelligence and algorithmic decision-making in organizations.\",\"the growing ubiquity of algorithms in society: implications, impacts and innovations. the growing ubiquity of algorithms in society raises a number of fundamental questions concerning governance of data, transparency of algorithms, legal and ethical frameworks for automated algorithmic decision-making and the societal impacts of algorithmic automation itself. this article, an introduction to the discussion meeting issue of the same title, gives an overview of current challenges and opportunities in these areas, through which accelerated technological progress leads to rapid and often unforeseen practical consequences. these consequences-ranging from the potential benefits to human health to unexpected impacts on civil society-are summarized here, and discussed in depth by other contributors to the discussion meeting issue. this article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'the growing ubiquity of algorithms in society: implications, impacts and innovations'.\",\"artificial intelligence in business and economics research: trends and future. artificial intelligence is a disruptive technology developed during the 20th century, which has undergone an accelerated evolution, underpinning solutions to complex problems in the business world. neural networks, machine learning, or deep learning are concepts currently associated with terms such as digital marketing, decision making, industry 4.0 and business digital transformation. interest in this technology will increase as the competitive advantages of the use of artificial intelligence by economic entities is realised. the aim of this research is to analyse the state-of-the-art research of artificial intelligence in business. to this end, a bibliometric analysis has been implement using the web of science and scopus online databases. by using a fractional counting method, this paper identifies 11 clusters and the most frequent terms used in artificial intelligence research. the present study identifies the main trends in research on artificial intelligence in business and proposes future lines of inquiry.\",\"mapping the future of occupations: transformative and destructive effects of new digital technologies on jobs. we investigate the impact of new digital technologies upon occupations. we argue that these impacts may be both destructive and transformative. the destructive effects of digitalization substitute human labor, while transformative effects of digitalization complement it. we distinguish between four broad groups of occupations that differ with regard to the impact of digitalization upon them. \\u201crising star\\u201d occupations are characterized by the low destructive and high transformative effects of digitalization. in contrast, \\u201ccollapsing\\u201d occupations face a high risk of destructive effects. \\u201chuman terrain\\u201d occupations have low risks of both destructive and transformative digitalization, whereas \\u201cmachine terrain\\u201d occupations are affected by both types. we analyze the differences between these four occupational groups in terms of the capabilities, which can be considered bottlenecks to computerization. the results help to identify which capabilities will be in demand and to what degree workers with different abilities can expect their occupations to be transformed in the digital era.\",\"cobots in knowledge work: human \\u2013 ai collaboration in managerial professions. current technological developments, as well as widespread application of artificial intelligence, will doubtlessly continue to impact how people live and work. in this research, we explored synergies between human workers and ai in managerial tasks. we hypothesized that human-ai collaboration will increase productivity. in the paper, several levels of proximity between ai and humans in a work setting are distinguished. the multi-stage study, covering the exploratory phase in which we conducted a study of preferences using 10-item likert scale, was conducted with a sample of 366 respondents. the study focused on working with different types of ai. the second and third phase of the study, in which we primarily used qualitative methods (scenario-based design combined with semi-structured interviews with six participants), focused on researching modes of collaboration between humans and virtual assistants. the study results generally confirmed our hypothesis about increased productivity due to enhanced human-ai collaboration, proving that the future of ai in knowledge work needs to focus not on full automation but rather on collaborative approaches where humans and ai work closely together.\",\"the implications of artificial intelligence on the digital marketing of financial services to vulnerable customers. artificial intelligence (ai) is rapidly transforming digital marketing practices. while the extant literature extensively covers ai applications that generally benefit businesses and customers, there is scant research on ai deployments that exacerbate problems for financially vulnerable customers. these customers have limited access to financial systems, services or technologies. to rectify this research deficit, this paper describes the challenges confronting businesses as they attempt to integrate ai into the digital marketing of their financial services. ultimately, al-enabled digital marketing is not as simple as collecting big data and using analytical algorithms; the technology may not always help businesses target their customers more effectively. this paper examines the relationships between ai, digital marketing, and financial services in relation to vulnerable customers, highlighting key implications in the collection, processing, and delivery of information, as well as the importance of human connection for optimal customer experience and engagement with financial services providers. understanding ethical implications, as well as data and modelling challenges, is necessary for the successful deployment of ai. this study provides a theoretical framework to financial services providers, ai developers, marketers, policymakers, and academics, aiding the understanding of the precarious conditions facing vulnerable customers, and the ways in which they can more effectively be reached.\",\"why artificial intelligence will not outsmart complex knowledge work. the potential role of artificial intelligence in improving organisations\\u2019 performance and productivity has been promoted regularly and vociferously since the 1960s. artificial intelligence is today reborn out of big business, similar to the occurrences surrounding big data in the 1990s, and expectations are high regarding ai\\u2019s potential role in businesses. this article discusses different aspects of knowledge work that tend to be ignored in the debate about whether or not artificial intelligence systems are a threat to jobs. a great deal of knowledge work concerns highly complex problem solving and must be understood in contextual, social and relational terms. these aspects have no generic nor universal rules and solutions and, thus, cannot be easily replaced by artificial intelligence or programmed into computer systems, nor are they constructed based on models of the rational brain. in this respect, this article draws on philosopher herbert dreyfus\\u2019 thesis regarding artificial intelligence.\",\"ethical considerations in artificial intelligence courses. the recent surge in interest in ethics in artificial intelligence (ai) may leave many educators wondering how to address moral, ethical, and philosophical issues in their ai courses. as instructors we want to develop curriculum that not only prepares students to be ai practitioners, but also to understand the moral, ethical, and philosophical impacts that ai will have on society. in this article we provide practical case studies and links to resources for use by ai educators. we also provide concrete suggestions on how to integrate ai ethics into a general ai course and how to teach a stand-alone ai ethics course.\",\"attitudes toward artificial intelligence in radiology with learner needs assessment within radiology residency programmes: a national multi-programme survey. introduction we aimed to assess the attitudes and learner needs of radiology residents and faculty radiologists regarding artificial intelligence (ai) and machine learning (ml) in radiology. methods a web-based questionnaire, designed using surveymonkey, was sent out to residents and faculty radiologists in all three radiology residency programmes in singapore. the questionnaire comprised four sections and aimed to evaluate respondents\\u2019 current experience, attempts at self-learning, perceptions of career prospects and expectations of an ai\\u002fml curriculum in their residency programme. respondents\\u2019 anonymity was ensured. results a total of 125 respondents (86 male, 39 female; 70 residents, 55 faculty radiologists) completed the questionnaire. the majority agreed that ai\\u002fml will drastically change radiology practice (88.8%) and makes radiology more exciting (76.0%), and most would still choose to specialise in radiology if given a choice (80.0%). 64.8% viewed themselves as novices in their understanding of ai\\u002fml, 76.0% planned to further advance their ai\\u002fml knowledge and 67.2% were keen to get involved in an ai\\u002fml research project. an overwhelming majority (84.8%) believed that ai\\u002fml knowledge should be taught during residency, and most opined that this was as important as imaging physics and clinical skills\\u002fknowledge curricula (80.0% and 72.8%, respectively). more than half thought that their residency programme had not adequately implemented ai\\u002fml teaching (59.2%). in subgroup analyses, male and tech-savvy respondents were more involved in ai\\u002fml activities, leading to better technical understanding. conclusion a growing optimism towards radiology undergoing technological transformation and ai\\u002fml implementation has led to a strong demand for an ai\\u002fml curriculum in residency education.\",\"human rights and artificial intelligence: an urgently needed agenda. the increasing presence of artificial intelligence creates enormous challenges for human rights. among the short-term challenges are ways in which technology engages just about all rights on the udhr, as exemplified through use of effectively discriminatory algorithms. medium-term challenges include changes in the nature of work that could call into question many people\\u2019s status as participants in society. in the long-term humans may have to live with machines that are intellectually and possibly morally superior, even though this is highly speculative. artificial intelligence also gives a new relevance to moral debates that used to strike many as arcane.\",\"machine ethics: the design and governance of ethical ai and autonomous systems. the so-called fourth industrial revolution and its economic and societal implications are no longer solely an academic concern, but a matter for political as well as public debate. characterized as the convergence of robotics, ai, autonomous systems and information technology - or cyberphysical systems - the fourth industrial revolution was the focus of the world economic forum, at davos, in 2016 [1]. also in 2016 the us white house initiated a series of public workshops on artificial intelligence (ai) and the creation of an interagency working group, and the european parliament committee for legal affairs published a draft report with recommendations to the commission on civil law rules on robotics.\",\"understanding managers\\u2019 attitudes and behavioral intentions towards using artificial intelligence for organizational decision-making. while using artificial intelligence (ai) could improve organizational decision-making, it also creates challenges associated with the \\u201cdark side\\u201d of ai. however, there is a lack of research on managers' attitudes and intentions to use ai for decision making. to address this gap, we develop an integrated ai acceptance-avoidance model (iaaam) to consider both the positive and negative factors that collectively influence managers' attitudes and behavioral intentions towards using ai. the research model is tested through a large-scale questionnaire survey of 269 uk business managers. our findings suggest that iaaam provides a more comprehensive model for explaining and predicting managers' attitudes and behavioral intentions towards using ai. our research contributes conceptually and empirically to the emerging literature on using ai for organizational decision-making. further, regarding the practical implications of using ai for organizational decision-making, we highlight the importance of developing favorable facilitating conditions, having an effective mechanism to alleviate managers\\u2019 personal concerns, and having a balanced consideration of both the benefits and the dark side associated with using ai.\",\"artificial intelligence and machine learning in finance: a bibliometric review. this study reviewed the artificial intelligence (ai) and machine learning (ml) literature in the finance field. using a bibliometric approach, we collected 348 articles published in 2011\\u20132021 from journals indexed in the scopus database. multiple software (rstudio, vosviewer, and excel) were employed to analyze the data and depict the most active scientific actors in terms of countries, institutions, sources, documents, and authors. our review revealed an upward trajectory in the publication trend starting from 2015 and found the application of ai and ml in bankruptcy prediction, stock price prediction, portfolio management, oil price prediction, anti-money laundering, behavioral finance, big data analytics, and blockchain. moreover, the united states, china, and the united kingdom were the top three contributors to the literature. our results provide practical guidance to market participants, especially, fintech and finance companies, on how ai and ml can be used in their decision-making.\",\"artificial intelligence and management: the automation\\u2013augmentation paradox. taking three recent business books on artificial intelligence (ai) as a starting point, we explore the automation and augmentation concepts in the management domain. whereas automation implies that machines take over a human task, augmentation means that humans collaborate closely with machines to perform a task. taking a normative stance, the three books advise organizations to prioritize augmentation, which they relate to superior performance. using a more comprehensive paradox theory perspective, we argue that, in the management domain, augmentation cannot be neatly separated from automation. these dual ai applications are interdependent across time and space, creating a paradoxical tension. overemphasizing either augmentation or automation fuels reinforcing cycles with negative organizational and societal outcomes. however, if organizations adopt a broader perspective comprising both automation and augmentation, they could deal with the tension and achieve complementarities that benefit business and society. drawing on our insights, we conclude that management scholars need to be involved in research on the use of ai in organizations. we also argue that a substantial change is required in how ai research is currently conducted in order to develop meaningful theory and to provide practice with sound advice. r academy of management review\",\"artificial intelligence in e-commerce fulfillment: a case study of resource orchestration at alibaba's smart warehouse. despite heightened interest, integrating artificial intelligence (ai) into businesses remains challenging. recent surveys show that up to 85 % of ai initiatives ultimately fail to deliver on their promises. studies on successful ai applications that could provide invaluable lessons for organizations embarking on their ai journey are still lacking. therefore, this study aims to understand how ai technology, people, and processes should be managed to successfully create value. building on the resource orchestration perspective, this study analyzes the successful applications of ai at alibaba's e-commerce fulfillment center. the findings indicate that the key ai resources include data, ai algorithms, and robots. these resources must be orchestrated (e.g., coordinated, leveraged, deployed) to work with other related resources, such as warehouse facilities and existing information systems, to generate strong ai capabilities. the key ai capabilities generated include forecasting, planning, and learning. more importantly, ai capabilities are not independent \\u2013 they interact and coevolve with human capabilities to create business value in terms of efficiency (e.g., space optimization, labor productivity) and effectiveness (e.g., error reduction). the implications of understanding these social informatics of ai for research and practice are discussed.\",\"influence of artificial intelligence (ai) on firm performance: the business value of ai-based transformation projects. purpose: the main purpose of our study is to analyze the influence of artificial intelligence (ai) on firm performance, notably by building on the business value of ai-based transformation projects. this study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of ai and ai concepts\\u002ftechnologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of ai-based solution providers; and (4) a review of ai literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of ai-enabled projects transformation within organizations. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this study has called on the theory of it capabilities to seize the influence of ai business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). the research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from ibm, aws, cloudera, nvidia, conversica, universal robots websites, etc. studying the influence of ai on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations\\u2019 ai-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase. findings: ai covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. organizations have been adopting ai technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. ai fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. thus, the results of our study have highlighted such ai benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. by building on these ai attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. the same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through ai capabilities only when they use their features\\u002ftechnologies to reconfigure their processes. research limitations\\u002fimplications: ai obviously influences the way businesses are done today. therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider ai as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. for the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of ai within organizations. in terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of ai on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. as for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of ai, and therefore improve organizations\\u2019 performance, the profitability of their investments in ai transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. this study also allows managers to consider ai not as a single technology but as a set\\u002fcombination of several different configurations of it in the various company\\u2019s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of ai: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. originality\\u002fvalue: this article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from ai deployment reports in organizations. the transformation of projects based on the use of ai focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of ai-based projects and the impact of ai on firm performance. more specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of ai at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set\\u002fcombination of the several different configurations of it in various industries.\",\"exploring the impact of artificial intelligence: prediction versus judgment. based on recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (ai), we examine what type of human labor will be a substitute versus a complement to emerging technologies. we argue that these recent developments reduce the costs of providing a particular set of tasks \\u2013 prediction tasks. prediction about uncertain states of the world is an input into decision-making. we show that prediction allows riskier decisions to be taken and this is its impact on observed productivity although it could also increase the variance of outcomes as well. we consider the role of human judgment in decision-making as prediction technology improves. judgment is exercised when the objective function for a particular set of decisions cannot be described (i.e., coded). however, we demonstrate that better prediction impacts the returns to different types of judgment in opposite ways. hence, not all human judgment will be a complement to ai. finally, we show that humans will delegate some decisions to machines even when the decision would be superior with human input.\",\"governing artificial intelligence to benefit the un sustainable development goals. big tech's unregulated roll-out out of experimental ai poses risks to the achievement of the un sustainable development goals (sdgs), with particular vulnerability for developing countries. the goal of financial inclusion is threatened by the imperfect and ungoverned design and implementation of ai decision-making software making important financial decisions affecting customers. automated decision-making algorithms have displayed evidence of bias, lack ethical governance, and limit transparency in the basis for their decisions, causing unfair outcomes and amplify unequal access to finance. poverty reduction and sustainable development targets are risked by big tech's potential exploitation of developing countries by using ai to harvest data and profits. stakeholder progress toward preventing financial crime and corruption is further threatened by potential misuse of ai. in the light of such risks, big tech's unscrupulous history means it cannot be trusted to operate without regulatory oversight. the article proposes effective pre-emptive regulatory options to minimize scenarios of ai damaging the sdgs. it explores internationally accepted principles of ai governance, and argues for their implementation as regulatory requirements governing ai developers and coders, with compliance verified through algorithmic auditing. furthermore, it argues that ai governance frameworks must require a benefit to the sdgs. the article argues that proactively predicting such problems can enable continued ai innovation through well-designed regulations adhering to international principles. it highlights risks of unregulated ai causing harm to human interests, where a public and regulatory backlash may result in over-regulation that could damage the otherwise beneficial development of ai.\",\"machine learning for enterprises: applications, algorithm selection, and challenges. machine learning holds great promise for lowering product and service costs, speeding up business processes, and serving customers better. it is recognized as one of the most important application areas in this era of unprecedented technological development, and its adoption is gaining momentum across almost all industries. in view of this, we offer a brief discussion of categories of machine learning and then present three types of machine-learning usage at enterprises. we then discuss the trade-off between the accuracy and interpretability of machine-learning algorithms, a crucial consideration in selecting the right algorithm for the task at hand. we next outline three cases of machine-learning development in financial services. finally, we discuss challenges all managers must confront in deploying machine-learning applications.\",\"drivers, barriers and social considerations for ai adoption in business and management: a tertiary study. the number of academic papers in the area of artificial intelligence (ai) and its applications across business and management domains has risen significantly in the last decade, and that rise has been followed by an increase in the number of systematic literature reviews. the aim of this study is to provide an overview of existing systematic reviews in this growing area of research and to synthesise the findings related to drivers, barriers and social implications of the ai adoption in business and management. the methodology used for this tertiary study is based on kitchenham and charter's guidelines [14], resulting in a selection of 30 reviews published between 2005 and 2019 which are reporting results of 2021 primary studies. these reviews cover the ai adoption across various business sectors (healthcare, information technology, energy, agriculture, apparel industry, engineering, smart cities, tourism and transport), management and business functions (hr, customer services, supply chain, health and safety, project management, decision-support, systems management and technology adoption). while the drivers for the ai adoption in these areas are mainly economic, the barriers are related to the technical aspects (e.g. availability of data, reusability of models) as well as the social considerations such as, increased dependence on non-humans, job security, lack of knowledge, safety, trust and lack of multiple stakeholders'perspectives. very few reviews outside of the healthcare management domain consider human, organisational and wider societal factors of the ai adoption. in addition to increased focus on social implications of ai, the reviews are recommending

approaches to user acceptance of internet of things in a smart home environment. with rapid improvements in communication technologies and infrastructure, the internet of things (iot) has become a promising sector within the global information and communication technology industry. various fields are employing the concept of iot for their traditional products and services for convenient use by consumers. in the construction industry, the majority of leading companies and organizations are using iot technologies in a smart home environment. however, only few studies have focused on the user experience of iot technologies in such an environment. thus, the current study explores the key determinants of user acceptance of iot technologies in a smart home environment, and investigates a research model integrated with five potential user factors and a technology acceptance model. the results of the collected data, which were investigated using a structural equation modeling method, show that three positive motivations, compatibility, connectedness, and control, and a negative hindrance, cost, are significant determinants of the technology acceptance behavior of users. the current study can serve as a foundation for future studies on improving iot technologies in a smart home environment by considering the user experience.\",\"influences of the industry 4.0 revolution on the human capital development and consumer behavior: a systematic review. automation and digitalization, as long-term evolutionary processes, cause significant effects, such as the transformation of occupations and job profiles, changes to employment forms, and a more significant role for the platform economy, generating challenges for social policy. this systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of the research to date related to influences of the industry 4.0 revolution on human capital development and consumer behavior. a search on the web of science identified 160 papers that met the inclusion criteria. the major objectives aimed to identify: the main types of influences of the industry 4.0 revolution on human capital development and consumer behavior; the main opportunities and challenges for new directions in education associated with shifting the work environment; and the drivers for human capital development and consumer behavior through the lenses of the industry 4.0 revolution. the results revealed some key aspects for the development of human capital: information, new jobs, the internet, technology, training, education, new skills, automation, communication, innovativeness, professionals, productivity, artificial intelligence, digitalization, e-recruitment, and the internet of things, as well as the main drivers of consumer behavior: information, e-commerce, digitalization, the internet of things, e-distribution, technology, digitalization, automation, personalized, performance, artificial intelligence, behavior intention, e-shopping, and data mining.\",\"the fourth industrial revolution\\u2013the case of south africa. on becoming president of south africa cyril ramaphosa put the fourth industrial revolution (4ir) into his national economic strategy, generating criticism for its neoliberal rhetoric echoing the world economic forum (wef) and concern it would not create jobs. 4ir is an umbrella term for 3d-printing, artificial intelligence (ai), big data, industrial internet of things (iiot) and robotics. for corporations it means rethinking strategies and auto-cannibalisation of business models. for policy-makers in manufacturing nations it is supposed to raise national competitiveness and bring manufacturing home, potentially blocking developing nations from creating jobs through attracting labour-intensive manufacturing. its effects on work and employment are forecast to be complex, potentially heightening inequality by reducing demand for low levels of skills. south africa has a significant skills shortage, due to failings in its education system, limiting the supply of managers, researchers and workers needed for 4ir. there are also problems of poor quality infrastructure, reflecting weak governance and state capture. it has a poor record in policy formulation and implementation, especially across departments, with notable delays in cybersecurity and data protection. there is only a small domestic market and, despite aspirations, it is not an easy gateway to the rest of africa, which has strong demographic growth but limited spending power and poor physical distribution systems. moreover, south african firms have to compete with a strong chinese presence.\",\"internet of things: a systematic review of the business literature from the user and organisational perspectives. the internet of things is a new technological paradigm that aims to connect anything and anyone at any time and any place, giving rise to innovative new applications and services. in doing so, it offers a number of opportunities and challenges that users and organisations need to tackle. in this paper we systematically review the business literature related to the internet of things and provide a critical account of the latest state of play. more specifically, we adopt two perspectives: that of the user and that of the organisation. after outlining the methodological approach adopted, we consider the definitions of the internet of things. then, in turn, we discuss the relevant business literature from each perspective. the paper concludes with a synthesis of the emerging themes and potential avenues for future research.\",\"explaining the intention to use digital personal data stores: an empirical study. recent data leaks such as those involving dropbox have apparently made internet users feel less secure than in the past as they face risks when dealing with their digital personal data. however, consumers have increasingly embraced cloud computing empowered digital personal data stores (dpdss). to understand this paradox, this study shifts the unit of analysis of dpdss acceptance from organizations to individuals\\u002fconsumers and identifies the drivers of adoption of dpdss (beyond broadly defined cloud computing services). moreover, it proposes, develops and tests empirically a comprehensive extended version of the technology acceptance model (tam) in the context of dpdss, leveraging perceived privacy risks and trust. using a panel of uk consumers, we find that perceived trust positively influences both usefulness and ease of use. these constructs, in turn, positively affect attitude towards using dpdss, which ultimately increases the intention to use dpdss. privacy risk does not moderate any of the investigated relationships, thus suggesting that trust is a key underlying mechanism enhancing the acceptance of dpds. hence, theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.\",\"the potentials of augmented reality in supply chain management: a state-of-the-art review. this paper examines the potentials of augmented reality (ar) technology in supply chain management (scm) and logistics. specifically, we provide an overview of the technology\\u2019s various value propositions and its ability to support companies\\u2019 business processes. although the emergence of industry 4.0 has renewed the interest in ar, and how it can address several issues challenging existing business models, rigorous studies investigating the potentials of ar for scm and logistics activities are scant. to bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic literature review to compile existing literature, identify current research gaps, and systematize ar research in scm and logistics activities. in total, forty-three (43) papers were thoroughly analyzed. the findings of this study reveal that ar can add value in five main areas, namely warehousing, manufacturing, sales and outdoor logistics, planning and design and human resource management. moreover, we discuss organizations\\u2019 challenges when deploying ar in scm and logistics and propose exploratory research opportunities for further investigation. in this paper, we highlight numerous practical implications of ar in scm and recommend that organizations consider ar as a potential solution for enhancing business processes, improving operational efficiencies, and increasing overall competitiveness. this study represents one of the first attempts to synthesize ar\\u2019s literature from an scm and logistics perspective.\",\"sensemaking throughout adoption and the innovation-decision process. purpose - current technology adoption research focuses on relationships between attitudes, intentions, behavior, and their various antecedents, but little is known about how these relationships develop and the processes by which adoption actually takes place. the purpose of this paper is to use karl weick's description of sensemaking from his book sensemaking in organizations, as a starting point for a sensemaking-based perspective on adoption. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach - the paper describes sensemaking, explains why it is an appropriate perspective for studying it adoption, and discusses it briefly in terms of existing adoption-related models and perspectives. the paper then discusses seven properties of sensemaking and their roles in the adoption process. a comparison of the sensemaking perspective of adoption to rogers' innovation-decision process model is presented. finally, questions to guide future development of the sensemaking perspective on adoption are highlighted. findings - seven properties of sensemaking are discussed with regard to technology adoption. these discussions produced a substantial number of research questions. originality\\u002fvalue - this perspective provides the opportunity for a much richer understanding of how adoption occurs and how it can be influenced.\",\"smart factory implementation and process innovation: a preliminary maturity model for leveraging digitalization in manufacturingmoving to smart factories presents specific challenges that can be addressed through a structured approach focused on people, processes, and technologies.. overview: the development of novel digital technologies connected to the internet of things, along with advancements in artificial intelligence and automation, is enabling a new wave of manufacturing innovation. \\u201csmart factories\\u201d will leverage industrial equipment that communicates with users and with other machines, automated processes, and mechanisms to facilitate real-time communication between the factory and the market to support dynamic adaptation and maximize efficiency. smart factories can yield a range of benefits, such as increased process efficiency, product quality, sustainability, and safety and decreased costs. however, companies face immense challenges in implementing smart factories, given the large-scale, systemic transformation the move requires. we use data gathered from in-depth studies of five factories in two leading automotive manufacturers to analyze these challenges and identify the key steps needed to implement the smart factory concept. based on our analysis, we offer a preliminary maturity model for smart factory implementation built around three overarching principles: cultivating digital people, introducing agile processes, and configuring modular technologies.\",\"emerging industrial revolution: symbiosis of industry 4.0 and circular economy: the role of universities. growing consumerism and population worldwide raises concerns about society\\u2019s sustainability aspirations. this has led to calls for concerted efforts to shift from the linear economy to a circular economy (ce), which are gaining momentum globally. ce approaches lead to a zero-waste scenario of economic growth and sustainable development. these approaches are based on semi-scientific and empirical concepts with technologies enabling 3rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) and 6rs (reuse, recycle, redesign, remanufacture, reduce, recover). studies estimate that the transition to a ce would save the world in excess of a trillion dollars annually while creating new jobs, business opportunities and economic growth. the emerging industrial revolution will enhance the symbiotic pursuit of new technologies and ce to transform extant production systems and business models for sustainability. this article examines the trends, availability and readiness of fourth industrial revolution (4ir or industry 4.0) technologies (for example, internet of things [iot], artificial intelligence [ai] and nanotechnology) to support and promote ce transitions within the higher education institutional context. furthermore, it elucidates the role of universities as living laboratories for experimenting the utility of industry 4.0 technologies in driving the shift towards ce futures. the article concludes that universities should play a pivotal role in engendering ce transitions.\",\"digitalization of agri-cooperatives in the smart agriculture context. proposal of a digital diagnosis tool. the use of digital technologies has been recognized as one of the great challenges for businesses of the 21st century. this digitalization is characterized by the intensive use of information technologies in the different stages of the value chain of a sector. in this context, smart agriculture is transforming the agricultural sector in terms of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. in some countries, cooperatives, as the most common legal form of the incumbent companies, in this rather traditional low-intensive technology sector, are going to develop a relevant role in the process of adoption of these technologies. in this context, this paper provides, first, a review of the evolution of the main digital technologies, such as internet of things, robots, artificial intelligence, big data, and blockchain, among others. second, a description of the digital innovation process in agri-cooperatives in order to help them in the decision-making process, and third, a digital diagnosis tool for measuring cooperatives' digital innovation. this tool is initially applied to two cases of agri-cooperatives in spain. all of this contributes to a better understanding of digitalization of agri-cooperatives in the context of smart agriculture.\",\"digital innovation and the fourth industrial revolution: epochal social changes?. itc technologies have come to comprehensively represent images and expectations of the future. hopes of ongoing progress, economic growth, skill upgrading and possibly also democratisation are attached to new icts as well as fears of totalitarian control, alienation, job loss and insecurity. currently, with the terms \\\"industry 4.0.\\\" and \\u2018fourth industrial revolution\\u201d (fir), public institutions (such as the national governments of germany, us, italy, france, and hollande), private institutions (the world economic forum, hedge funds, commercial banks), and literature refer to the inchoate transformation of production of goods and services resulting from the application of a new wave of technological innovations: interconnected collaborative robots; machine learning; artificial intelligence; 3d printers connected to digital development software; simulation of interconnected machines; integration of the information flow along the value chain; multidirectional communication between manufacturing processes and products (internet of things). according to the main representations of industry 4.0. by private and public institutions, its effects are expected to be mainly positive, for what regards productivity, economic opportunities and the future of work. the positive potentials now attributed to the new cycle of innovation evoke and expand those attributed to the previous waves of innovation linked to itc technologies, and, even before, to the transition from fordism to post-fordism. however, these transformations have so far not achieved any of the promises they raised. improvements for workers in terms of work conditions, work performance and work relationships cannot be determined by any technical innovation in itself, being technological innovation always socially shaped.\",\"industrial internet of things business models in the machine-to-machine context. this study analyzes industrial internet of things (iiot) business models in the machine-to-machine (m2m) context. thereby, it develops a conceptual framework to categorize different types of business model innovation for companies operating in the m2m business space. business model innovations tend to cross multiple industries and drive ecosystems in which smart objects facilitate business models and service applications that are incrementally or radically novel in terms of their modularity or architecture. our framework identifies four distinct types of iiot business models: (i) company-specific business models, (ii) systemic business models, (iii) value designs, and (iv) systemic value designs. moreover, it sheds light on different abstraction levels of business model building blocks and exposes the characteristics and differences in the value potential between the four business models. finally, we advance the idea of \\u2018value design\\u2019 referring to business models of multiple actors coupled together, ultimately resulting in complex networks and ecosystems of diverse things, processes, and companies.\",\"big data analytics for physical internet-based intelligent manufacturing shop floors. physical internet (pi, \\u03c0) has been widely used for transforming and upgrading the logistics and supply chain management worldwide. this study extends the pi concept into manufacturing shop floors where typical logistics resources are converted into smart manufacturing objects (smos) using internet of things (iot) and wireless technologies to create a rfid-enabled intelligent shop floor environment. in such pi-based environment, enormous rfid data could be captured and collected. this study introduces a big data analytics for rfid logistics data by defining different behaviours of smos. several findings are significant. it is observed that task weight is primarily considered in the logistics decision-making in this case. additionally, the highest residence time occurs in a buffer with the value of 12.17 (unit of time) which is 40.57% of the total delivery time. that implies the high work-in-progress inventory level in this buffer. key findings and observations are generated into managerial implications, which are useful for various users to make logistics decisions under pi-enabled intelligent shop floors.\",\"the strategic role of logistics in the industry 4.0 era. by leveraging new technologies (additive manufacturing, advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, blockchain, drones, internet of things, etc.), many companies are developing cyber-physical systems that can change the competition landscape. in the midst of this exciting development, we examine the strategic role of logistics and transportation services for creating economic, environmental and social values. also, we discuss some new research directions.\",\"exploring the application sphere of the internet of things in industry 4.0: a review,

industry 4.0 iot enablers by integrated pca-ism-dematel approach. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to identify, analyze and model internet of things (iot) enablers essential for the success of industry 4.0. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: iot enablers for industry 4.0 are identified from literature and inferable discussions with industry experts. three different techniques namely, principal component analysis (pca), interpretive structural modeling (ism) and decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (dematel) are applied to model iot enablers. in addition to this, dematel is also applied under two different situations representing the behavioral characteristic of experts involved. these are termed as optimistic (maximum) and pessimistic (minimum). findings: the integrated approach of pca-ism-dematel shows that iot ecosystem and iot big data are the most influential or driving iot enablers. these two enablers have been identified as the pillars for industry 4.0. on the other side, iot interchangeability, consumer iot, iot robustness and iot interface and network capability have also been identified as the most dependent enablers for industry 4.0. practical implications: the findings enable the industry practitioners to select the most appropriate driving enablers for an effective implementation of industry 4.0. originality\\u002fvalue: the integrated approach-based hierarchical model and cause-effect relationship among iot enablers are proposed which is a novel initiative for industry 4.0. moreover, two different variants of dematel namely, pessimistic and optimistic are applied first time.\",\"birth of industry 5.0: making sense of big data with artificial intelligence, \\\"the internet of things\\\" and next-generation technology policy. driverless cars with artificial intelligence (ai) and automated supermarkets run by collaborative robots (cobots) working without human supervision have sparked off new debates: what will be the impacts of extreme automation, turbocharged by the internet of things (iot), ai, and the industry 4.0, on big data and omics implementation science? the iot builds on (1) broadband wireless internet connectivity, (2) miniaturized sensors embedded in animate and inanimate objects ranging from the house cat to the milk carton in your smart fridge, and (3) ai and cobots making sense of big data collected by sensors. industry 4.0 is a high-tech strategy for manufacturing automation that employs the iot, thus creating the smart factory. extreme automation until \\\"everything is connected to everything else\\\" poses, however, vulnerabilities that have been little considered to date. first, highly integrated systems are vulnerable to systemic risks such as total network collapse in the event of failure of one of its parts, for example, by hacking or internet viruses that can fully invade integrated systems. second, extreme connectivity creates new social and political power structures. if left unchecked, they might lead to authoritarian governance by one person in total control of network power, directly or through her\\u002fhis connected surrogates. we propose industry 5.0 that can democratize knowledge coproduction from big data, building on the new concept of symmetrical innovation. industry 5.0 utilizes iot, but differs from predecessor automation systems by having three-dimensional (3d) symmetry in innovation ecosystem design: (1) a built-in safe exit strategy in case of demise of hyperconnected entrenched digital knowledge networks. importantly, such safe exists are orthogonal - in that they allow \\\"digital detox\\\" by employing pathways unrelated\\u002funaffected by automated networks, for example, electronic patient records versus material\\u002farticle trails on vital medical information; (2) equal emphasis on both acceleration and deceleration of innovation if diminishing returns become apparent; and (3) next generation social science and humanities (ssh) research for global governance of emerging technologies: \\\"post-elsi technology evaluation research\\\" (peter). importantly, peter considers the technology opportunity costs, ethics, ethics-of-ethics, framings (epistemology), independence, and reflexivity of ssh research in technology policymaking. industry 5.0 is poised to harness extreme automation and big data with safety, innovative technology policy, and responsible implementation science, enabled by 3d symmetry in innovation ecosystem design.\",\"smart maintenance: an empirically grounded conceptualization. how do modernized maintenance operations, often referred to as \\u201csmart maintenance\\u201d, impact the performance of manufacturing plants? the inability to answer this question backed by data is a problem for industrial maintenance management, especially in light of the ongoing rapid transition towards an industrial environment with pervasive digital technologies. to this end, this paper, which is the first part of a two-paper series, aims to investigate and answer the question, \\u201cwhat is smart maintenance?\\u201c. the authors deployed an empirical, inductive research approach to conceptualize smart maintenance using focus groups and interviews with more than 110 experts from over 20 different firms. by viewing our original data through the lens of multiple general theories, our findings chart new directions for contemporary and future maintenance research. this paper describes empirical observations and theoretical interpretations cumulating in the first empirically grounded definition of smart maintenance and its four underlying dimensions; data-driven decision-making, human capital resource, internal integration, and external integration. in addition, the relationships between the underlying dimensions are specified and the concept structure formally modeled. this study thus achieves concept clarity with respect to smart maintenance, thereby making several theoretical and managerial contributions that guide both scholars and practitioners within the field of industrial maintenance management.\",\"make disruptive technological change happen - the case of additive manufacturing. disruptive technological change can contribute to a more abundant world. however, potentially disruptive technologies often struggle to significantly influence practice. one prominent example is additive manufacturing (am). although am is often regarded as the next great technological revolution in waiting, it has not yet established itself on a large scale in many fields of application. we investigate the reasons behind those challenges by looking at the various fields in which am is applied and relating them to the specific challenges am faces, as well as the opportunities it offers in those fields. our findings rely on a multi-perspective technology foresight process that is based on a discourse analytic approach and that comprises data tomography covering the biggest german-language online magazine on am and qualitative interview data collected from a range of am stakeholders. the findings provide an empirically well-founded evaluation and explanation of the link between the challenges and opportunities offered by am and the extent to which this disruptive technology is leveraged in specific fields. the findings prompt recommendations on how new potentially disruptive technologies can foster abundance in traditional, well established market economies based on the example of the well-developed but traditional market economy of austria.\",\"understanding the internet of things ecosystem: multi-level analysis of users, society, and ecology. purpose: this study aims to conduct socio-technical analysis of the rapidly evolving internet of things (iot) ecosystem and industry, including such factors as market growth and user experiences, policy and the impact of iot on various areas. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: by applying a multi-level socio-technical framework to iot in south korea, this study seeks an ecological understanding of how iot will evolve and stabilize in a smart environment. findings: the study shows the values influencing potential users\\u2019 adoption of iot by integrating cognitive motivations and user values as primary determining factors. along with user modeling, the findings reveal the challenges of designing, deploying and sustaining the diverse components of iot, and provides a snapshot of korea\\u2019s current approach to meeting these challenges. originality\\u002fvalue: the study\\u2019s findings offer a contextualized socio-technical analysis of iot, providing insight into its challenges and opportunities. this insight helps to conceptualize how iot can be designed and situated within human-centered contexts.\",\"evaluation of advanced construction technology with ahp method. it is difficult to quantify the intangible benefits of advanced construction technologies and the risks involved in implementing such technologies with the use of traditional economic analysis techniques. an analytical approach to assessing the intangible aspects of technical innovation in construction is presented. the approach uses the analytical hierarchy process (ahp) technique and incorporates both favorable and unfavorable evaluation factors in one framework. the methods for constructing the comparison matrices, measuring the consistency of the pairwise comparisons, and aggregating the eigenvectors for the matrices to produce a final result are discussed. the sources of information for evaluation using the ahp method are identified and the significance of the method as a communication tool for group discussion is addressed. an example evaluation of two towercrane alternatives, one traditional and one semiautomated, is given to demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach. the effect of the managerial judgments on the acceptability of a new technology alternative is shown via a sensitivity analysis.\",\"patented intelligence: cloning human decision models for industry 4.0. industry 4.0 is a trend related to smart factories, which are cyber-physical spaces populated and controlled by the collective intelligence for the autonomous and highly flexible manufacturing purposes. artificial intelligence (ai) embedded into various planning, production, and management processes in industry 4.0 must take the initiative and responsibility for making necessary real-time decisions in many cases. in this paper, we suggest the pi-mind technology as a compromise between completely human-expert-driven decision-making and ai-driven decision-making. pi-mind enables capturing, cloning and patenting essential parameters of the decision models from a particular human expert making these models transparent, proactive and capable of autonomic and fast decision-making simultaneously in many places. the technology facilitates the human impact (due to ubiquitous presence) in smart manufacturing processes and enables human-ai shared responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made. it also benefits from capturing and utilization of the traditionally human creative cognitive capabilities (sometimes intuitive and emotional), which in many cases outperform the rational decision-making. pi-mind technology is a set of models, techniques, and tools built on principles of value-based biased decision-making and creative cognitive computing to augment the axioms of decision rationality in industry.\",\"development of an industry 4.0 maturity model for the delivery process in supply chains. purpose: this paper aims to show that current industry 4.0 maturity models primarily focus on manufacturing processes. until now, research has been lacking with regard to outbound logistics, that is, the delivery process. this paper develops such a model. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: methodologically, this paper is grounded in design science research (dsr) and rigorously follows the model development guidelines presented by de bruin et al. (2005). this work builds on current maturity models and original empirical research to populate and test the model. findings: the model appears to be applicable to describing the status quo of the digitization efforts in outbound logistics, developing a corporate vision for delivery logistics excellence and providing guidance on the development path. research limitations\\u002fimplications: thus far, the model has been applied only for a development stakeholder. for further validation, the authors are currently working on additional case studies to demonstrate the model\\u2019s applicability. practical implications: the developed model provides guidance for the digitization of an important value-adding activity in supply chain management: the delivery process. originality\\u002fvalue: to the authors\\u2019 knowledge, the proposed model is the first to explicitly consider the delivery process; therefore, it complements available approaches that focus on the manufacturing process. moreover, the results show that the widely used supply chain operations reference model can serve as the basis for additional process maturity models.\",\"the internet of things and corporate business models: a systematic literature review. the paper proposes a systematic literature review emphasising scholars\\u2019 view on the role of iot in shaping and developing business models of companies. providing a deep understanding of the state of the art, the paper drafts implications and valuable insights to address future research. a two-decade study of the connection of internet of things and business models has been investigated using scopus and isi web of science databases as leading sources to get access to the articles. the diffusion of internet of things needs to be investigated along its implications for corporate business models, such as modifications in the production process, interaction with customers and in the identification of the corporate building blocks. this study provides for the first time a systematic connection among iot and business models towards the lens of business, management and accounting field, providing valuable implications, insights and emerging issues.\",\"a collaborative apparel new product development process model using virtual reality and augmented reality technologies as enablers. this study presents a collaborative new product development (npd) process model that accommodates different perspectives of stakeholders in an apparel value chain and expedites robust new product outcomes. advanced technologies are demanded to establish such collaborative npd process models. virtual reality (vr) and augmented reality (ar) technologies have become prominent in product realisation during this process, to evaluate multiple alternatives. the study proposes a twofold approach where, in the first phase, a qualitative study was carried out to evaluate the viewpoint of value stream collaborators to study the potential opportunities and limitations of applying vr and ar in npd process. in the second phase, a quantitative study was carried out to assess the apparel consumers\\u2019 awareness on vr or ar applications, perceptions on such technologies, and intention to use such technologies in the context of apparel business. data collection consisted of 10 in-depth interviews with experts in the industry and 94 survey responses from apparel consumers in the united kingdom. it is concluded that vr and ar technologies will be enablers for npd\\u2019s success in the apparel industry in providing quick responses to consumers to enhance the performance of the new products.\",\"quality 4.0: a review of big data challenges in manufacturing. industrial big data and artificial intelligence are propelling a new era of manufacturing, smart manufacturing. although these driving technologies have the capacity to advance the state of the art in manufacturing, it is not trivial to do so. current benchmarks of quality, conformance, productivity, and innovation in industrial manufacturing have set a very high bar for machine learning algorithms. a new concept has recently appeared to address this challenge: quality 4.0. this name was derived from the pursuit of performance excellence during these times of potentially disruptive digital transformation. the hype surrounding artificial intelligence has influenced many quality leaders take an interest in deploying a quality 4.0 initiative. according to recent surveys, however, 80\\u201387% of the big data projects never generate a sustainable solution. moreover, surveys have indicated that most quality leaders do not have a clear vision about how to create value of out these technologies. in this manuscript, the process monitoring for quality initiative, quality 4.0, is reviewed. then four relevant issues are identified (paradigm, project selection, process redesign and relearning problems) that must be understood and addressed for successful implementation. based on this study, a novel 7-step problem solving strategy is introduced. the proposed strategy increases the likelihood of successfully deploying this quality 4.0 initiative.\",\"the role of open innovation and value co-creation in the challenging transition from industry 4.0 to society 5.0: toward a theoretical framework. advanced manufacturing solutions, augmented reality, and cloud and big data are technologies pertaining to industry 4.0. these technologies improve working conditions, create new business models, and increase both productivity and firm quality production. however, they can also improve life and society as a whole. this new perspective, oriented toward social and global well-being, is called society 5.0. as has happened for all past industrial revolutions, industry 4.0 will support the transition to a different society, i.e., society 5.0. in this transition, open innovation and value co-creation can play an important role. the aim of the study was twofold: to examine how industry 4.0 features and enabling technologies can support the transition to society 5.0 and to investigate the roles of both open innovation and value co-creation within this transition. a conceptual framework was developed to jointly consider for the first time industry 4.0, society 5.0, open innovation, and value co-creation, which are all challenging issues that firms must cope with nowadays. managers could profit from these insights to design ad hoc strategies in order to benefit from the opportunities emerging from this transition and overcome the main related challenges.\",\"iot in supply chain management: a narrative on retail sector sustainability. the internet of things (iot) is a global platform of internet-connected smart devices that strengthens the supply chain ict infrastructure for greater integration within an organisation and externally with suppliers and customers. however, the iot literature so far remains theoretical and excessively focused on its technology and potential applications, with a very limited revelation of its operational benefits. therefore, the study explores the ground reality of iot impact on supply chain integration and performance. twelve semi-structured interviews with managers from the australian retail industry were thematically analysed using nvivo. the findings reveal that multiple iot forms provide additional capabilities in data auto-capture, visibility, intelligence, and information sharing for greater integration of retail supply chains. that, in turn, enhances supply chain performance in cost, quality, delivery, and flexibility dimensions to improve firm financial, social, and environmental sustainability. the study outlines the theoretical and practical contributions arising from the deployment of iot.\",\"backshoring manufacturing: notes on an important but under-researched theme. this note discusses the phenomenon of backshoring manufacturing relying on empirical results based on a large-scale danish questionnaire-survey. the note argues for further research on antecedents,

as a dynamic capability serves as a predecessor to cope with the dynamics of globalisation strategies and supply chain design.\",\"the fourth industrial revolution: opportunities and challenges. the fourth industrial revolution, a term coined by klaus schwab, founder and executive chairman of the world economic forum, describes a world where individuals move between digital domains and offline reality with the use of connected technology to enable and manage their lives. (miller 2015, 3) the first industrial revolution changed our lives and economy from an agrarian and handicraft economy to one dominated by industry and machine manufacturing. oil and electricity facilitated mass production in the second industrial revolution. in the third industrial revolution, information technology was used to automate production. although each industrial revolution is often considered a separate event, together they can be better understood as a series of events building upon innovations of the previous revolution and leading to more advanced forms of production. this article discusses the major features of the four industrial revolutions, the opportunities of the fourth industrial revolution, and the challenges of the fourth industrial revolution.\",\"disruptive technologies in smart cities: a survey on current trends and challenges. this paper aims to explore the most important disruptive technologies in the development of the smart city. every smart city is a dynamic and complex system that attracts an increasing number of people in search of the benefits of urbanisation. according to the united nations, 68% of the world population will be living in cities by 2050. this creates challenges related to limited resources and infrastructure (energy, water, transportation system, etc.). to solve these problems, new and emerging technologies are created. internet of things, big data, blockchain, artificial intelligence, data analytics, and machine and cognitive learning are just a few examples. they generate changes in key sectors such as health, energy, transportation, education, public safety, etc. based on a comprehensive literature review, we identified the main disruptive technologies in smart cities. applications that integrate these technologies help cities to be smarter and offer better living conditions and easier access to products and services for residents. disruptive technologies are generally considered key drivers in smart city progress. this paper presents these disruptive technologies, their applications in smart cities, the most important challenges and critics.\",\"the enabling technologies of industry 4.0: examining the seeds of the fourth industrial revolution. technological revolutions mark profound transformations in socio-economic systems. they are associated with the development and diffusion of general-purpose technologies (gpts) that display very high degrees of pervasiveness, dynamism and complementarity. this article provides an in-depth examination of the technologies underpinning the \\\"factory of the future\\\"as profiled by the industry 4.0 paradigm. it contains an exploratory comparative analysis of the technological bases and the emergent patterns of development of internet of things, big data, cloud, robotics, artificial intelligence, and additive manufacturing. we qualify the \\\"enabling\\\"nature of these technologies. we then test

topic from an industrial structural change perspective.\",\"blockchain for industrial transformations: a forward-looking approach with multi-stakeholder engagement for policy advice. beyond more recognized financial applications of blockchain, its potential for other sectors has increasingly come to the foreground. yet, its development still faces questions over impact, added value, or concrete paths for widespread deployment. in this paper we argue for a transdisciplinary forward-looking approach to address such uncertainties, based on the processes and findings of the research project #blockchain4eu: blockchain for industrial transformations, which was developed inside the european commission with a focus on multi-stakeholder engagement and co-creation. we invested in a mix of desk research with qualitative methods, including interviews, surveys, or ethnographic explorations, together with participatory workshops for collective vision building and speculative prototyping for policy. our main findings underline key sociotechnical challenges and opportunities for the development and uptake of blockchain in specific european industrial and business contexts, taking into account the complexity of policy, economic, social, technical, legal and environmental elements. but, aiming to push the frontiers of what's common practice in advice for policy when looking into early-stage technologies as blockchain, we also strive to emphasize how our approach can benefit decision-makers through robust methodological and conceptual processes that are simultaneously evidence-based and experimental in their delivery and impact.\",\"a structured literature review on the interplay between emerging technologies and covid-19 \\u2013 insights and directions to operations fields. in recent years, emerging technologies have gained popularity and being implemented in different fields. thus, critical leading-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and other related technologies (blockchain, simulation, 3d printing, etc.) are transforming the operations and other traditional fields and proving their value in fighting against unprecedented covid-19 pandemic outbreaks. however, due to this relation's novelty, little is known about the interplay between emerging technologies and covid-19 and its implications to operations-related fields. in this vein, we mapped the extant literature on this integration by a structured literature review approach and found essential outcomes. in addition to the literature mapping, this paper's main contributions were identifying literature scarcity on this hot topic by operations-related fields; consequently, our paper emphasizes an urgent call to action. also, we present a novel framework considering the primary emerging technologies and the operations processes concerning this pandemic outbreak. also, we provided an exciting research agenda and four propositions derived from the framework, which are collated to operations processes angle. thus, scholars and practitioners have the opportunity to adapt and advance the framework and empirically investigate and validate the propositions for this and other highly disruptive crisis.\",\"electric vehicles\\u2019 consumer behaviours: mapping the field and providing a research agenda. research on consumers of electric vehicles appears to offer significant contributions relative to the behaviour factors that stimulate purchase. although it is one of the topics most endorsed by international organisations, a holistic compendium of the literature is not provided. therefore, different research directions necessitate a clear systematisation. this study moves in this direction by conducting a bibliometric and thematic analysis of 254 studies related to consumer behaviour in the electric car market. the research reveals the primary co-citation network between international journals and authors, a map of the leading research centres on the topic, and the dimensions covered by scholars. additionally, the analysis extends the theory of planned behaviour, offering a valuable consumer identikit for practitioners. based on the results, the study provides multiple research questions helpful to feed the academic debate.\",\"covid-19 and hospitality 5.0: redefining hospitality operations. the sudden outbreak of covid-19 has severely affected the global hospitality industry. the hygiene and cleanliness of hotels has become the focal point in the recovery plan during covid-19. this study investigates the effects of past disasters on the global hospitality industry, and how the industry responded to them. since past pandemics and epidemics identified hygiene and cleanliness as an important factor, this study further explores the role of technology in ensuring hygiene and cleanliness. hence, this study further examines the scalability of industry 5.0 design principles into the hospitality context, leading to hospitality 5.0 to improve operational efficiency. the study further delineates how hospitality 5.0 technologies can ensure hygiene and cleanliness in various touchpoints in customer's journey. this study serves as a foundation to understand how synergy between humans and machines can be achieved through hospitality 5.0. the theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\",\"fostering digital transformation of smes: a four levels approach. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to analyse how digital technologies trigger changes in the business process of

industry 4.0, was beget with emergent and disruptive intelligence and information technologies. these new technologies are enabling ever-higher levels of production efficiencies. they also have the potential to dramatically influence social and environmental sustainable development. organizations need to consider industry 4.0 technologies contribution to sustainability. sufficient guidance, in this respect, is lacking in the scholarly or practitioner literature. in this study, we further examine industry 4.0 technologies in terms of application and sustainability implications. we introduce a measures framework for sustainability based on the united nations sustainable development goals; incorporating various economic, environmental and social attributes. we also develop a hybrid multi-situation decision method integrating hesitant fuzzy set, cumulative prospect theory and vikor. this method can effectively evaluate industry 4.0 technologies based on their sustainable performance and application. we apply the method using secondary case information from a report of the world economic forum. the results show that mobile technology has the greatest impact on sustainability in all industries, and nanotechnology, mobile technology, simulation and drones have the highest impact on sustainability in the automotive, electronics, food and beverage, and textile, apparel and footwear industries, respectively. our recommendation is to take advantage of industry 4.0 technology adoption to improve sustainability impact but each technology needs to be carefully evaluated as specific technology will variably influence industry and sustainability dimensions. investment in such technologies should consider appropriate priority investment and championing.\",\"behind the definition of industry 4.0: analysis and open questions. the many scholars approaching industry 4.0 today need to confront the lack of an agreed-upon definition, posing serious limitations to theory building and research comparability. since its initial german conceptualization in 2011, both the technological landscape and the understanding of the industry 4.0 have evolved significantly leading to several ambiguities. in parallel, similar concepts often used as synonyms \\u2212 such as \\u201csmart manufacturing\\u201d, \\u201cdigital transformation\\u201d, and \\u201cfourth industrial revolution\\u201d \\u2212 have increased the sense of confusion around the scope and characteristics of the phenomenon. this study approaches the issue through an analysis of almost 100 definitions of industry 4.0 and related concepts. the review of academic publications has been complemented by a selection of the most influential non-academic sources, including governmental bodies and consulting companies. each definition has been broken down into its underlying technological and non-technological definitional elements. this categorization will serve as a basis for future research to approach the phenomenon in its multiple facets.\",\"wearable technology and consumer interaction: a systematic review and research agenda. there has been exponential growth is the use of wearable technology, and these are now considered to be of critical importance in certain consumer goods and services sectors, including healthcare. however, research on this topic remains fragmented, and the approaches to aid its study and enhance the understanding of how these technologies are used and its implications for the future have not yet been delimited. thus, this study aims at identifying the different trends and themes prevailing in the literature on wearable technology. through a systematic literature review, using bibliometric analysis, we identify five themes: i) wearable technology decision-making; ii) wearable technology well-being; iii) wearable technology consumer behavior; iv) wearable technology utility, and v) wearable technology and big data analytics. our analysis of the review data suggests that despite being multi-disciplinary, there is a lack of integration between this research field's micro and macro perspectives. this lack of integration and dialogue has led to several disconnected constructed terminologies, overlapping research questions, studies that are not based on appropriate results, fragmentation, and mixing or confusion of different theories. the study articulates key questions that could drive future research on wearables and consumer interaction.\",\"sustainable industrial and operation engineering trends and challenges toward industry 4.0: a data driven analysis. this study supplies contributions to the existing literature with a state-of-the-art bibliometric review of sustainable industrial and operation engineering as the field moves toward industry 4.0, and guidance for future studies and practical achievements. although industrial and operation engineering is being promoted forward to sustainability, the systematization of the knowledge that forms firms\\u2019 manufacturing and operations and encompasses their wide concepts and abundant complementary elements is still absent. this study aims to analyze contemporary sustainable industrial and operations engineering in industry 4.0 context. the bibliometric analysis and fuzzy delphi method are proposed. resulting in a total of 30 indicators that are criticized and clustered into eight study groups, including lean manufacturing in industry 4.0, cyber-physical production system, big data-driven and smart communications, safety and security, artificial intelligence for sustainability, the circular economy in a digital environment, business intelligence and virtual reality, and environmental sustainability.\",\"understanding ai adoption in manufacturing and production firms using an integrated tam-toe model. this study aims to identify how environmental, technological, and social factors influence the adoption of industry 4.0 in the context of digital manufacturing. the industry 4.0 era has brought a breakthrough in advanced technologies in fields such as nanotechnology, quantum computing, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, robotics, the internet of things, fifth-generation wireless technology, fully autonomous vehicles, 3d printing and so on. in this study, we attempted to identify the socioenvironmental and technological factors that influence the adoption of artificial intelligence embedded technology by digital manufacturing and production organizations. in doing so, the extended technology-organization-environment (toe) framework is used to explore the applicability of industry 4.0. a conceptual model was proposed that used an integrated technology acceptance model (tam)-toe model and was tested using survey-based data collected from 340 employees of small, medium and large organizations. the results highlight that all the relationships, except organizational readiness, organizational compatibility and partner support on perceived ease of use, were found to be significant in the context of digital manufacturing and production organizations. the results further indicated that leadership support acts as a countable factor to moderate such an adoption.\",\"technology acceptance model for the use of information technology in universities. the problem described in this research is to identify which factors influence on engineering students about their acceptance of an academic administrative information system in private universities in lima, peru. the objective is to identify factors by proposing a technology acceptance model of an academic and administrative information system. university population is described, both private and public. the investigation is based on two private universities. the results show the relationship between the selected variables. finally, recommendations are given to act on the variables that determine the acceptance of information technology.\",\"supply chain 4.0: concepts, maturity and research agenda. purpose: industry 4.0 is one of the most emergent research topics attracting significant interest by researchers as well as practitioners. many articles have been published with regards industry 4.0; however, there is no research that clearly conceptualizes industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain. this paper aims to propose the term \\u201csupply chain 4.0\\u201d together with a novel conceptual framework that captures the essence of industry 4.0 within the supply chain context. as industry 4.0 is inherently a revolution, and as revolutions are evolutionary, this research also aims to capture the evolution of supply chain 4.0 from maturity levels perspective to facilitate the formulation and development of supply chain 4.0 strategy. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: following a deductive research approach and a qualitative strategy, a systematic literature review (slr) was adopted as the research method seeking to understand the relationships among supply chain, industry 4.0 and maturity levels research. the three phases of the slr process utilized are: planning, conducting and reporting. a concept-oriented technique was applied to the outputs of the slr to obtain the key constructs that would facilitate the development of the conceptual supply chain 4.0 framework. findings: the slr showed that there is limited research linking industry 4.0 to supply chain. nevertheless, it was possible to extract a set of thematic categories from the analysis of the articles which are referred to as constructs as they form the core of the conceptual supply chain 4.0 framework. these constructs are managerial and capability supporters, technology levers, processes performance requirements and strategic outcomes. each of these constructs consists of a number of elements which are referred to as \\u201cdimensions\\u201d in this research and a total of 21 dimensions were identified during the slr. the slr also demonstrated that maturity propositions for industry 4.0 are still embrionary and entirely missing in the context of supply chain. hence, this research develops and proposes a maturity levels framework that is underpinned by the core constructs of supply chain 4.0 and the corresponding dimensions. as these proposed frameworks are conceptual, this research also identifies and proposes several research directions to help fortify the supply chain 4.0 concept. research limitations\\u002fimplications: this research argues that the frameworks are robust because the constructs and dimensions are grounded in the literature, thus demonstrating both theoretical and practical relevance and value. as supply chain 4.0 research is still in infancy, there is a range of open research questions suggested based on the frameworks that could serve as guides for researchers to further develop the supply chain 4.0 concept. also, practitioners can use this framework to develop better understanding of supply chain 4.0 and be able to evaluate the maturity of their organizations. as the proposed frameworks are conceptual, they require further empirical research to validate them and obtain new insights. originality\\u002fvalue: the slr demonstrated a clear gap in literature with regards to industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain, and also in the context of industry 4.0 maturity levels for supply chain. this research is unique as it formulates and introduces novel frameworks that close these gaps in literature. the value of this research lies in the fact that it makes significant contribution in terms of understanding of supply chain 4.0 with a clear set of constructs and dimensions that form supply chain 4.0, which provides the foundation for further work in this area.\",\"a living lab as socio-technical ecosystem: evaluating the korean living lab of internet of things. living lab approaches, as one of socio-technical approaches, are effective strategy for user-driven technology development. the recent development of the internet of things (lot) and its various technologies appear to be promising possibilities to adopt living lab innovation into community domains. using living lab frame, this study examines the developmental processes of the iot from a multi-level analysis: a micro approach of user acceptance and experience of iot services; a meso approach of socio-technical evaluation of selected site; and a macro approach of regulation and strategies on iot. through the multi-level approach, it conceptualizes a living lab process to create, test, and adept a social iot environment. the findings should guide governments\\u2019 promotion of iot services to increase user acceptance by enhancing usability and benefits and ensuring sustainability. the findings also provide guidelines, strategies, and best practices for practitioners to integrate iot into communities and society effectively. the insights help to conceptualize how the iot can be situated and contextualized within human-centered contexts. the results of this study show that creating iot innovations require prudent coordination of different stakeholders and roles across innovation cycle. particularly user-centered approach warrants a new innovative way to structure and facilitate user involvement within the context of living labs for iot.\",\"the fourth industrial revolution and implications for innovative cluster policies. the fourth industrial revolution has become a global buzz word since the world economic forum (wef) adopted it as an annual issue in 2016. it is represented by hyper automation and hyper connectivity based on artificial intelligence (ai), big data, robotics, and internet of things (iot). ai, big data, and robotics can contribute to developing hyper automation that can increase productivity and intensify industrial production. particularly, robots using ai can make decision by themselves as human being on complicated processes. along with the hyper automation, the hyper connectivity increases not only at national, but also global level by using information and communication technologies (ict). iot is the core technology to create the hyper connectivity in cyber physical system (cps) that connects technology, nature, and human being. accordingly, a perfect convergence between ict and manufacturing can be completed in the fourth industrial revolution era and an extremely efficient flexible production system by spreading iot in cps will be established. under such a condition, innovative clusters must play their traditional roles in cradles of technology innovation and commercialization. it must be difficult challenges for innovative clusters to meet their targets and to be adjusted by the changing new environment at the same time. this paper argues how the fourth industrial revolution can change the global production chain and how core technologies function in industries. furthermore, it focuses on how innovative clusters have to evolve to respond the fourth industrial revolution. last, but not least it also analyzes whether or not innovative clusters can play their roles as technology innovation hubs in the real world and cps in the fourth industrial revolution era.\",\"considering industry 4.0 aspects in the supply chain for an sme. industry 4.0 is a buzzword in current research and in the manufacturing environment. however, despite this limited research has focused on how a company can determine the likely benefits of industry 4.0 technologies and its influence on the supply chain. additionally, the aspect of customer experience is gaining significant importance in the new industry 4.0 supply chain. there is a research gap in implementation strategies of industry 4.0 concepts for small and medium sized enterprises (smes). this paper addresses this gap through an in-depth case study of an sme and highlights how the company can develop competitive advantage. first, a framework was developed to determine the realization of industry 4.0 predicted benefits for smes, which was tested in a case company. based on input from the case the five-step framework for industry 4.0 realization is adjusted. it enables practitioners to determine the actual status for their company towards industry 4.0 realization and thereby functions as a guide for further implementation strategies.\",\"analysis of the adoption of emergent technologies for risk management in the era of digital manufacturing. the industry 4.0 (i4.0) revolution has led to rapid digital transformation, automation of manufacturing processes and efficient decision-making in business operations. despite the potential benefits of i4.0 technologies in operations management reported in the extant literature, there has been a paucity of empirical research examining the intention to adopt i4.0 technologies for managing risks. risk management identifies, assesses, and introduces responses for risks to avert crises. this study combines institutional theory, the resource-based view and the technology acceptance model to develop a novel behavioural model examining the adoption of big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and blockchain for risk management from the operations manager's perspective, which has never been examined in the literature. the model was tested for each i4.0 technology using data collected from 117 operations managers in the uk manufacturing industry which were analysed using structural equation modelling. we contribute to the theory on i4.0 in digital manufacturing by showing the impact of digital transformation maturity, market pressure, regulations, and resilience on the perceived usefulness and adoption of these technologies for managing risks in business operations. based on the findings, we discuss implications for operations managers effectively and efficiently to adopt i4.0 technologies aiming to boost operational productivity.\",\"industry 4.0 as a data-driven paradigm: a systematic literature review on technologies. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to identify current technologies related to industry 4.0 and to develop a rationale to enhance the understanding of their functions within a data-driven paradigm. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a systematic literature review of 119 papers published in journals included in the journal citation report (jcr) was conducted to identify industry 4.0 technologies. a descriptive analysis characterizes the corpus, and a content analysis identifies the technologies. findings: the content analysis identified 111 technologies. these technologies perform four functions related to data: data generation and capture, data transmission, data conditioning, storage and processing and data application. the first three groups consist of enabling technologies and the fourth group of value-creating technologies. results show that industry 4.0 publications focus on enabling technologies that transmit and process data. value-creating technologies, which apply data in order to develop new solutions, are still rare in the literature. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the proposed framework serves as a structure for analysing the focus of publications over time, and enables the classification of new technologies as the paradigm evolves. practical implications: because the technical side of the new production paradigm is complex and represents an evolving field, managers benefit from a simplified and data-driven approach. the proposed framework suggests that industry 4.0 should be approached by looking at how data can create value and at what role each technology plays in this task. originality\\u002fvalue: the study makes a direct link between industry 4.0 technologies and the key resource of this revolution, i.e. data. it provides a rationale that not only establishes relationships between technologies and data, but also highlights their roles as enablers or creators of value. beyond showing the current focus of industry 4.0 publications, this paper proposes a framework that is useful for tracking the evolution of the paradigm.\",\"proposed managerial competencies for industry 4.0 \\u2013 implications for social sustainability. industry 4.0 (i4.0) is creating a paradigm shift within the current industrial context. the study presented in this paper involved identifying and proposing the managerial competencies needed for a successful i4.0 environment. i4.0 is a complex phenomenon that spans multiple technologies and requires an extensive set of capabilities that managers and organizations need to develop in their functional and business contexts. using the published literature on i4.0, we uncovered the key themes following a qualitative coding method that identified the managerial competencies most relevant to i4.0. we thus identify a set of 14 managerial competencies as crucial to i4.0. we further contribute to the literature by making an assessment of the significance of all these competencies and proposing a competency model with behavioral descriptors for each. we expect the findings in this paper to benefit business organizations, policy makers, academics, and other stakeholders engaged in developing the capabilities required for an i4.0 ecosystem.\",\"industry 4.0, innovation, and sustainable development: a systematic review and a roadmap to sustainable innovation. despite the recent interest in the industry 4.0 applications for sustainability, little is known on the processes through which digital transformation and industry 4.0 technologies enable sustainable innovation in manufacturing. the present study addresses this knowledge gap by developing a strategic roadmap that explains how businesses can leverage industry 4.0 technologies to introduce sustainability into innovative practices. for this purpose, the study conducts a systematic review of extant literature to identify industry 4.0 functions for sustainable innovation and applies interpretive structural modeling to devise the promised roadmap. the results offer interesting insights into industry 4.0 applications for sustainable innovation. the strategic roadmap developed reveals that industry 4.0 enables sustainable innovation through 11 functions. industry 4.0 and the underlying digital technologies and principles allow businesses to improve interfunctional collaboration and better integrate with internal and external stakeholders. industry 4.0 further improves the knowledge base and advanced manufacturing competency and promotes organizational capabilities valuable to sustainable innovation such as green absorptive capacity, sustainable partnership, and sustainable innovation orientation. through these functions, industry 4.0 subsequently enhances green process innovation capacity and the ability to develop or reintroduce eco-friendly products economically and competitively. overall, the roadmap explains the complex precedence relationships among the 11 sustainable innovation functions of industry 4.0, offering important implications for businesses that seek to leverage industry 4.0 sustainability implications and manage sustainable development.\",\"technologies, opportunities and challenges of the industrial revolution 4.0: theoretical considerations. objective: the aim of this article is to identify the impact of the industrial revolution 4.0 (ir 4.0) on the

advance: a review of industry 4.0 through machine learning. industry 4.0 has attracted considerable interest from firms, governments, and individuals as the new concept of future computer, industrial, and social systems. however, the concept has yet to be fully explored in the scientific literature. given the topic's broad scope, this work attempts to understand and clarify industry 4.0 by analyzing 660 journal papers and 3,901 news articles through text mining with unsupervised machine learning algorithms. based on the results, this work identifies 31 research and application issues related to industry 4.0. these issues are categorized and described within a five-level hierarchy: 1) infrastructure development for connection, 2) artificial intelligence development for data-driven decision making, 3) system and process optimization, 4) industrial innovation, and 5) social advance. further, a framework for convergence in industry 4.0 is proposed, featuring six dimensions: connection, collection, communication, computation, control, and creation. the research outcomes are consistent with and complementary to existing relevant discussion and debate on industry 4.0, which validates the utility and efficiency of the data-driven approach of this work to support experts\\u2019 insights on industry 4.0. this work helps establish a common ground for understanding industry 4.0 across multiple disciplinary perspectives, enabling further research and development for industrial innovation and social advance.\",\"on the road to digital servitization \\u2013 the (dis)continuous interplay between business model and digital technology. purpose: the authors seek to understand the process of digital servitization as a shift of manufacturing companies from the provision of standard products and services to smart solutions. specifically, the authors focus on changes in the business model (i.e. the value proposition, the value delivery system and the value capture mechanism) for digital servitization. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the authors examine a chinese air conditioner manufacturer, gree, who became the global leader with their smart solutions. these solutions included performance-based contracts underpinned by artificial intelligence (ai)-powered air conditioners that automatically adjust to environmental changes and are capable of remote monitoring and servicing thanks to its internet of things (iot) technology. findings: to successfully offer smart solution value propositions, a manufacturer needs an ecosystem value delivery system composed of suppliers, distributors, partners and customers. once the ecosystem relationships are well aligned, the manufacturer gains value with multiple value capture mechanisms (i.e. efficiency, accountability, shared customer value and novelty). to arrive at this point, a manufacturer has to pass through different stages that are characterized by both discontinuous and continuous interplay between business models and digital technologies. at the beginning of each stage, new value propositions and value delivery systems are first discontinuously created and then enabled with digital technology. as a result, new value capture mechanisms are activated. meanwhile, the elements of the existing business model are continuously improved. research limitations\\u002fimplications: by combining process-perspective and business-model lenses, the authors offer nuanced insights into how digital servitization unfolds. practical implications: executives can obtain insights into the business model elements, they need to change over the course of digital servitization and how to manage the process. originality\\u002fvalue: a longitudinal case study of a traditional manufacturer that has achieved stellar success through digital servitization business models development.\",\"technology mining: artificial intelligence in manufacturing. the period of the fourth industrial revolution, called industry 4.0, is characterized by new, innovative technologies such as: cloud computing; the internet of things; the industrial internet of things; big data; blockchain; cyber-physical systems; artificial intelligence, and so on. artificial intelligence technology plays a significant role in modern manufacturing, particularly in the context of the industry 4.0 paradigm. this article offers a visual and a comprehensive study of the application of artificial intelligence in manufacturing. existing scholarly literature on artificial intelligence in manufacturing, within the web of science core collection databases, is examined in two periods: 1979-2010 and 2011-2019. these periods are viewed, respectively, as before and after the emergence of the term industry 4.0. bibliometric and content analysis of relevant literature is conducted and key findings are subsequently identified. the results indicate that the most important topics today are: cyber-physical systems and smart manufacturing; deep learning and big data; and real-time scheduling algorithms.\",\"prerequisites for the adoption of ai technologies in manufacturing \\u2013 evidence from a worldwide sample of manufacturing companies. in current discussions, artificial intelligence (ai) is ascribed great influence on production processes. research on ai has seen tremendous growth in recent years. however, most of the research has focused primarily on various ai technologies, and less on prerequisites and enablers for adoption of ai at firm-level. this is surprising, given the fact that many companies are still struggling to establish ai in their production and to drive their ai adoption forward. to close this gap, this study analyses the impact of various technological, organizational and environmental (toe) prerequisites for a successful adoption of ai technologies in manufacturing. based on a cross-national survey of 655 company representatives from the manufacturing industry, our results contribute to a better understanding of why some companies are more determined than others when it comes to implementing ai in their production. we find evidence that organizational factors, such as digital skills, company size, and r&d intensity, have the greatest impact on the adoption of ai in manufacturing. furthermore, in order to gain new insights into the interplay of new technology adoption and global production strategies, this paper addresses the question of which factors explain a primarily domestic or globally

by a robot: service implications in the age of the machine. service organizations, emboldened by the imperative to innovate, are increasingly introducing robots to frontline service encounters. however, as they augment or substitute human employees with robots, they may struggle to convince a distrusting public of their brand\\u2019s ethical credentials. consequently, this article develops and tests a holistic framework to ascertain a deeper understanding of customer perceptions of frontline service robots (flsrs) than has previously been attempted. our experimental studies investigate the effects of the (1) role (augmentation or substitution of human employees or no involvement) and (2) type (humanoid flsr vs. self-service machine) of flsrs under the following service contexts: (a) value creation model (asset-builder, service provider) and (b) service type (experience, credence). by empirically establishing our framework, we highlight how customers\\u2019 personal characteristics (openness-to-change and preference for ethical\\u002fresponsible service provider) and cognitive evaluations (perceived innovativeness, perceived ethical\\u002fsocietal reputation, and perceived innovativeness-responsibility fit) influence the impact that flsrs have on service experience and brand usage intent. our findings operationalize and empirically support seminal frameworks from extant literature, as well as elaborate on the positive and negative implications of using robots to complement or replace service employees. further, we consider managerial and policy implications for service in the age of machines.\",\"exploring customer experiences with robotics in hospitality. purpose: the purpose of this study is to explore consumer reviews with robotics based on the five dimensions for evaluating user experiences (i.e. embodiment, emotion, human-oriented perception, feeling of security and co-experience), as derived from research in human-robot interactions (hri). design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the study first reviews the five dimensions for evaluating user experiences in hri and then analyzes user experiences with robotics at four hotels (i.e. yotel new york, aloft cupertino, henn-na hotel japan and marriott residence inn lax) based on reviews on tripadvisor, agoda, yelp and booking.com. findings: the findings highlight the influence of robotic embodiment and human-oriented perceptions on consumer experiences. the findings also suggest that users and robots can co-create novel experiences, with some guests even proactively seeking new opportunities to interact and communicate with robots to develop a certain level of \\u201crelationship\\u201d with them. research limitations\\u002fimplications: an understanding of user experiences from hris can inform future hospitality and tourism research and management. practical implications: this study contributes to hospitality and tourism management by highlighting current practices with robotics to suggest areas of improvements for enhancing future consumer experiences. social implications: consumer experiences will change rapidly as hospitality and tourism management deploys robotics in the future. originality\\u002fvalue: this is one of the early studies in the field to explore consumer experiences with robotics based on the five dimensions for evaluating user experiences from research in hri. in doing so, this study provides a number of theoretical and managerial implications relevant for hospitality and tourism research and practice.\",\"frontline robots in tourism and hospitality: service enhancement or cost reduction?. robots are being implemented in many frontline services, from waiter robots in restaurants to robotic concierges in hotels. a growing number of firms in hospitality and tourism industries introduce service robots to reduce their operational costs and to provide customers with enhanced services (e.g. greater convenience). in turn, customers may consider that such a disruptive innovation is altering the established conditions of the service-provider relationship. based on attribution theory, this research explores how customers\\u2019 attributions about the firm motivations to implement service robots (i.e. cost reduction and service enhancement) are affecting customers\\u2019 intentions to use and recommend this innovation. following previous research on robot\\u2019s acceptance, our research framework analyzes how these attributions may be shaped by customers\\u2019 perceptions of robot\\u2019s human-likeness and their affinity with the robot. structural equation modelling is used to analyze data collected from 517 customers evaluating service robots in the hospitality industry; results show that attributions mediate the relationships between affinity toward the robot and customer behavioral intentions to use and recommend service robots. specifically, customer\\u2019s affinity toward the service robot positively affects service improvement attribution, which in turn has a positive influence on customer behavioral intentions. in contrast, affinity negatively affects cost reduction attribution, which in turn has a negative effect on behavioral intentions. finally, human-likeness has a positive influence on affinity. this research provides practitioners with empirical evidence and guidance about the introduction of service robots and its relational implications in hospitality and tourism industries. theoretical advances and future research avenues are also discussed.\",\"leveraging human-robot interaction in hospitality services: incorporating the role of perceived value, empathy, and information sharing into visitors\\u2019 intentions to use social robots. social robots have become pervasive in the tourism and hospitality service environments. the empirical understanding of the drivers of visitors' intentions to use robots in such services has become an urgent necessity for their sustainable deployment. certainly, using social androids within hospitality services requires organisations' attentive commitment to value creation and fulfilling service quality expectations. in this paper, via structural equation modelling (sem) and semi-structured interviews with managers, we conceptualise and empirically test visitors' intentions to use social robots in hospitality services. with data collected in singapore's hospitality settings, we found visitors' intentions to use social robots stem from the effects of technology acceptance variables, service quality dimensions leading to perceived value, and two further dimensions from human robot interaction (hri): empathy and information sharing. analysis of these dimensions' importance provides a deeper understanding of novel opportunities managers may take advantage of to position social robot-delivered services in tourism and hospitality strategies.\",\"optimal capacity and operation design of a robot logistics system for the hotel industry. this study introduces an optimal capacity and operation design of a robot logistics system that can reduce human workload in the hotel industry. in hotels, there are several duties that can be replaced by robots such as accompanying guests to the certain areas, delivering specific items to the guest rooms, and transporting some items that guests want to be removed from the guest rooms. to apply the robot logistics system in the hotel industry, the capacity and operation design should be prepared adequately. for that, a mathematical model-based optimization technique is used to decide the number of robots with the concept of minimizing total investment cost and to derive the optimal job assigning with the purpose of maximizing total covered jobs. in addition, a numerical example is performed to validate the proposed mathematical model and the sensitivity tests are examined to reflect the random features.\",\"how sincere is an apology? recovery satisfaction in a robot service failure context. this study examined the effects of service recovery entities (i.e., robot-generated text, robot-generated voice, and human service employee) on recovery satisfaction through the mediation of perceived sincerity. this study also tested the moderating role of the need for human interaction. the results of this study suggest that people perceive service recovery provided by a human to be more sincere than that provided by a service robot, thereby leading to higher levels of satisfaction. moreover, this effect is stronger for those with a stronger need for human interaction. however, differences in perceived sincerity and recovery satisfaction were not identified between the use of service robots generating either text or a voice to express an apology. this study contributes to the theoretical discussion on ways to enhance customer experiences in robot service environments and provides insights that can guide service management in the hospitality and tourism industry.\",\"rise of the machines: towards a conceptual service-robot research framework for the hospitality and tourism industry. purpose: this study aims to introduce a conceptual framework for service robot (sr) acceptance by customers, employees and policymakers \\u2013 a framework to help determine corporate decision-making on sr workplace integration. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this study reviews sr adoption literature within the tourism and hospitality industry. these srs may have some level of artificial intelligence capability and possibly anthropomorphic (e.g. humanoid) or zoomorphic (e.g. animal-like) features, contingent on task and design choices. the study then identifies factors that potentially influence employee and consumer acceptance and experiences of sr, as well as policy and compliance factors and all elements of the corporate decision-making process concerning sr adoption in the hospitality setting. findings: this paper reviews the obstacles and benefits of sr adoption in the hospitality industry based on employee, consumer and public policy considerations. research limitations\\u002fimplications: srs are increasingly deployed within hospitality and tourism settings. future studies should further explore the value-adding functions of srs implemented in existing hospitality operations. practical implications: hospitality and tourism industry practitioners should integrate the dimensions in the conceptual framework to make fully informed decisions on sr adoption. originality\\u002fvalue: to the best of the authors\\u2019 knowledge, this is one of the first studies to provide a holistic sr adoption framework offering theoretical and practical implications for ongoing sr research and implementation.\",\"enablers and inhibitors of ai-powered voice assistants: a dual-factor approach by integrating the status quo bias and technology acceptance model. this study investigates the factors that build resistance and attitude towards ai voice assistants (aiva). a theoretical model is proposed using the dual-factor framework by integrating status quo bias factors (sunk cost, regret avoidance, inertia, perceived value, switching costs, and perceived threat) and technology acceptance model (tam; perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness) variables. the study model investigates the relationship between the status quo factors and resistance towards adoption of aiva, and the relationship between tam factors and attitudes towards aiva. a sample of four hundred and twenty was analysed using structural equation modeling to investigate the proposed hypotheses. the results indicate an insignificant relationship between inertia and resistance to aiva. perceived value was found to have a negative but significant relationship with resistance to aiva. further, the study also found that inertia significantly differs across gender (male\\u002ffemale) and age groupings. the study's framework and results are posited as adding value to the extant literature and practice, directly related to status quo bias theory, dual-factor model and tam.\",\"exploring the influence of culture on tourist experiences with robots in service delivery environment. robots and artificial intelligence represent a newly emerging trend in tourism and hospitality. however, studies examining how cultural perceptions influence tourists\\u2019 experiences interacting with service robots are lacking. in response to the industrial trend, the experiential components of robot-staffed hotels are assessed in this study. a qualitative approach is adopted to compare the semantic networks of japanese and non-japanese tourists\\u2019 online reviews, using 1,498 reviews from nine robot-staffed hotels in japan. the results indicate that hotel guests\\u2019 interaction with robots is one of the main experiential components in robot-staffed hotels. the semantic network analysis results demonstrate noticeable differences, with japanese reviews demonstrating more emotional responses to human-robot

purpose: this paper aims to discuss the effects of covid-19 on hotel marketing and management practices and outlines a three-pronged research agenda to stimulate knowledge development in the hotel sector. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this paper is based on an overview of the relevant literature on hotel marketing and management and the hotel guest behavior. the authors also investigated hospitality service trends to propose a research agenda. findings: this paper presents a research agenda from three dimensions \\u2013 artificial intelligence (ai) and robotics, hygiene and cleanliness and health and health care. first, different types of ai (mechanical, thinking and feeling) might open up distinct research streams at the intersection of health crises and hotel management, in light of the covid-19 pandemic. additionally, this paper recommends that researchers move beyond typical perspectives on the antecedents and outcomes of hotel hygiene and cleanliness to delve into guests\\u2019 perceptions of the cleanliness of specific hotel surfaces. furthermore, a more in-depth analysis is warranted about the evolving relationship between hotels and the health-care sector. practical implications: the recommended research areas are intended to advance the knowledge base to help hotels recover from the covid-19 pandemic. the suggested research streams are expected to provide actionable insights to promote the development and sustainability of the hotel sector. originality\\u002fvalue: this paper appears to be a frontier study, critically examining possible effects of the covid-19 pandemic on hotel marketing and management practices and how hoteliers may respond to such challenges to recover after this pandemic.\",\"avatar design of virtual salespeople: mitigation of recommendation conflicts. the role of virtual salesperson (vs) and the importance of customer reviews in facilitating online purchase decisions and sales have recently received much attention from technology companies, marketing practice professionals, and academics. however, customers\\u2019 willingness to follow the purchase advice of the vs when there is a conflict between these recommendations and those of other online customers is less understood. this research theorizes and investigates the extent to which customers\\u2019 relationship satisfaction with, and trust in, the vs helps explain customer willingness to follow vs advice in the context of recommendation conflict. using four studies, our research explores how and when the vs\\u2019s avatar design mitigates the negative influence of conflict. an important theoretical and managerial implication of this research is that vs avatar designs that are high in automated social presence (asp) help reduce the negative impact of conflict. however, we find that asp mitigates the negative effects of conflict only for avatars that score low (vs. high) on cuteness.\",\"service robots and covid-19: exploring perceptions of prevention efficacy at hotels in generation z. purpose: covid-19 is expected to enhance hospitality robotization because frontline robots facilitate social distancing, lowering contagion risk. investing in frontline robots emerges as a solution to recover customer trust and encourage demand. however, we ignore how customers perceive these initiatives and, therefore, their efficacy. focusing on robot employment at hotels and on generation z customers, this study aims to analyze guests\\u2019 perceptions about robots\\u2019 covid-19 prevention efficacy and their impact on booking intentions. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this study tests its hypotheses combining an experimental design methodology with partial least squares. survey data from 711 generation z individuals in spain were collected in 2 periods of time. findings: generation z customers consider that robots reduce contagion risk at hotels. robot anthropomorphism increases perceived covid-19 prevention efficacy, regardless of the context where the robots are used. robots\\u2019 covid-19 prevention efficacy provokes better attitudes and higher booking intentions. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the sampling method used in this research impedes this study\\u2019s results generalization. further research could replicate this study using random sampling methods to ensure representativeness, even for other generational cohorts. practical implications: employing robots as a covid-19 prevention measure can enhance demand, especially if robots are human-like. hoteliers need to communicate that robots can reduce contagion risk, particularly in markets more affected by covid-19. robots must be employed in low social presence contexts. governments could encourage robotization by financially supporting hotels and publicly acknowledging its benefits regarding covid-19 prevention. originality\\u002fvalue: this study combines preventive health, robotics and hospitality literature to study robot implementation during the covid-19 pandemic, focusing on generation z guests \\u2013 potential facilitators of robot diffusion.\",\"customers\\u2019 evaluation of mechanical artificial intelligence in hospitality services: a study using online reviews analytics. purpose: this paper aims to analyze if and to what extent mechanical artificial intelligence (ai)-embedded in hotel service robots-influences customers\\u2019 evaluation of ai-enabled hotel service interactions. this study deploys online reviews (ors) analytics to understand if the presence of mechanical ai-related text in ors influences customers\\u2019 or valence across 19 leading international hotels that have integrated mechanical ai \\u2013 in the guise of service robots \\u2013 into their operations. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: first, the authors identified the 19 leading hotels across three continents that have pioneered the adoption of service robots. second, by deploying big data techniques, the authors gathered the entire population of ors hosted on tripadvisor (almost 50,000 ors) and generated or analytics. subsequently, the authors used ordered logistic regressions analyses to understand if and to what extent ai-enabled hospitality service interactions are evaluated by service customers. findings: the presence of mechanical ai-related text (text related to service robots) in ors influences positively electronic word-of-mouth (e-wom) valence. hotel guests writing ors explicitly mentioning their interactions with the service robots are more prone to associate high online ratings to their ors. the presence of the robot\\u2019s proper name (e.g., alina, wally) in the or moderates positively the positive effect of mechanical ai-related text on ors ratings. research limitations\\u002fimplications: hospitality practitioners should evaluate the possibility to introduce service robots into their operations and develop tailored strategies to name their robots (such as using human-like and short names). moreover, hotel managers should communicate more explicitly their initiatives and investments in ai, monitor ai-related e-wom and invest in educating their non-tech-savvy customers to understand and appreciate ai technology. platform developers might create a robotic tag to be attached to ors mentioning service robots to signal the presence of this specific element and might design and develop an additional service attribute that might be tentatively named \\u201cservice robots.\\u201d originality\\u002fvalue: the current study represents the first attempt to understand if and to what extent mechanical ai in the guise of hotel service robots influences customers\\u2019 evaluation of ai-enabled hospitality service interactions.\",\"service robots, agency and embarrassing service encounters. purpose: extant research mainly focused on potentially negative customer responses to service robots. in contrast, this study is one of the first to explore a service context where service robots are likely to be the preferred service delivery mechanism over human frontline employees. specifically, the authors examine how customers respond to service robots in the context of embarrassing service encounters. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this study employs a mixed-method approach, whereby an in-depth qualitative study (study 1) is followed by two lab experiments (studies 2 and 3). findings: results show that interactions with service robots attenuated customers' anticipated embarrassment. study 1 identifies a number of factors that can reduce embarrassment. these include the perception that service robots have reduced agency (e.g. are not able to make moral or social judgements) and emotions (e.g. are not able to have feelings). study 2 tests the base model and shows that people feel less embarrassed during a potentially embarrassing encounter when interacting with service robots compared to frontline employees. finally, study 3 confirms that perceived agency, but not emotion, fully mediates frontline counterparty (employee vs robot) effects on anticipated embarrassment. practical implications: service robots can add value by reducing potential customer embarrassment because they are perceived to have less agency than service employees. this makes service robots the preferred service delivery mechanism for at least some customers in potentially embarrassing service encounters (e.g. in certain medical contexts). originality\\u002fvalue: this study is one of the first to examine a context where service robots are the preferred service delivery mechanism over human employees.\",\"developing and validating a service robot integration willingness scale. as new technologies continue to advance consumer experience, utilization of service robots and artificial intelligence to deliver human

(sriw) scale that uncovers the key dimensions characterizing consumers\\u2019 long-term willingness to integrate artificial intelligence and service robots into regular service transactions. drawing on a five-stage scale development procedure, a 36-item six-dimensional sriw scale was developed, which includes performance efficacy, intrinsic motivation, anthropomorphism, social influence, facilitating condition, and emotions. the sriw scale demonstrates rigorous psychometric properties per findings of construct validity and reliability tests, and invariance analysis across four service industries (e.g., hotels, restaurants, airlines, and retail stores) where service robots have already been or are likely to be launched. theoretical and managerial implications of the sriw scale and directions for future research are elaborated.\",\"preference for robot service or human service in hotels? impacts of the covid-19 pandemic. robots and artificial intelligence (ai) technologies are becoming more prominent in the tourism industry. nowadays, consumers are faced with multiple options involving both human and robot interactions. a series of experimental studies were implemented. four experiments demonstrated that consumers had a more positive attitude toward robot-staffed (vs. human-staffed) hotels when covid-19 was salient. the results were different from previous studies, which were conducted before the covid-19 pandemic. since the moderating role of perceived threat in consumers\\u2019 preference for robot-staffed hotels was significant, the respondents\\u2019 preference was attributed to the global health crisis. this research provides a number of theoretical and managerial implications by improving the understanding of technology acceptance during a

unanticipated challenge from the covid-19 pandemic. however, research in this area is scarce. accordingly, this study aims to unfold a three-angled research agenda to intensify the knowledge advancement in the hospitality sector. it proposes a theoretical framework by extending the protection motivation theory (pmt) to explain the guest\\u2019s intent to adopt artificial intelligence (ai) and robotics as a protective measure in reaction to covid-19. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the research is centered on outlining the pertinent literature on hospitality management practices and the guest\\u2019s transformed behavior during the current crisis. this study intends to identify a research agenda based on investigating hospitality service trends in today\\u2019s changing times. findings: the study sets out a research agenda that includes three dimensions as follows: ai and robotics, cleanliness and sanitation and health care and wellness. this study\\u2019s findings suggest that ai and robotics may bring out definite research directions at the connection of health crisis and hospitality management, taking into account the covid-19 crisis. practical implications: the suggested research areas are anticipated to propel the knowledge base and help the hospitality industry retrieve the covid-19 crisis through digital transformation. ai and robotics are at the cusp of invaluable advancement that can revive the hotels while re-establish guests\\u2019 confidence in safe hotel practices. the proposed research areas are likely to impart pragmatic lessons to the hospitality industry to fight against disruptive situations. originality\\u002fvalue: this study stands out to be pioneer research that incorporated ai and robotics to expand the pmt and highlights how behavioral choices during emergencies can bring technological revolution.\",\"adoption of ai-empowered industrial robots in auto component manufacturing companies. the usage of ai-empowered industrial robots (inros) is booming in the auto component manufacturing companies (acmcs) across the globe. based on a model leveraging the technology, organisation, and environment (toe) framework, this work examines the adoption of inros in acmcs in the context of an emerging economy. this research scrutinises the adoption intention and potential use of inros in acmcs through a survey of 460 senior managers and owners of acmcs in india. the findings indicate that perceived compatibility, external pressure, perceived benefits and support from vendors are critical predictors of inros adoption intention. interestingly, the study also reveals that it infrastructure and government support do not influence inros adoption intention. furthermore, the analysis suggests that perceived cost issues negatively moderate the relationship between the adoption intention and potential use of inros in acmcs. this study offers a theoretical contribution as it deploys the traditional toe framework and discovers counter-intuitively that it resources are not a major driver of technology adoption: as such, it suggests that a more comprehensive framework than the traditional rbv should be adopted. the work provides managerial recommendations for managers, shedding light on the antecedents of adoption intention and potential use of inros at acmcs in a country where the adoption of inros is in a nascent stage.\",\"machine learning of robots in tourism and hospitality: interactive technology acceptance model (itam) \\u2013 cutting edge. purpose: the purpose of this study is to discuss how consumers accept advanced artificial intelligence (ai) robots in hospitality and tourism and provide a typology and conceptual framework to support future research on advanced robot applicability. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this research reviews current cases of ai use and technology acceptance model (tam) studies and proposes a framework, interactive technology acceptance model (itam), to identify key determinants that stimulate consumer perceptions of advanced robot technology acceptance. findings: the main constructs and types of advanced robots were identified by reviewing tam studies and ai robots that are currently used in the tourism and hospitality industry. this research found that as technologies tested in tam studies have been improved by highly interactive systems, increased capability and a more user-friendly interface, examining perceived interactivity of technology has become more important for advanced robot acceptance

in gastronomy tourism: what's on the menu?. the use of robots in hospitality and tourism is rapidly evolving. restaurants progressively include robots as part of their staff, not only as waiters but also as chefs. the robotization of tourism and gastronomic experiences is a vital challenge that both service providers and customers need to cope with. within this context, the paper investigates the perceptions of tourists towards the use of robots in restaurants. drawing from a qualitative research design and built on a grounded theory approach, the results reveal the opportunities derived from the implementation of robots in hospitality and tourism. on the other hand, tourists also perceive the growing presence of robots in food services as a form of dehumanization of the gastronomic experience. theoretical and practical implications are discussed with regard to a new experiencescape that is increasingly dominated by human-robot interactions.\",\"a review of research into

concomitant to the trend, many hotel brands have adopted a robot-based automation system in their properties. this study attempted to understand the underlying perceptions of the hotel guests' robot-using behaviors. a sample of 494 potential users of a hotel robot assistant was examined and analyzed. the result showed six factors, including three functional aspects (i.e., facilitating conditions, performance expectancy, and innovativeness) and three emotional aspects (i.e., social presence, hedonic motivation, and perceived importance). moreover, this study categorized the respondents into cohesive groups that show similar characteristics. based on different levels of perceptions and demographic information, four clusters were named as \\u2018the ordinary,\\u2019 \\u2018enthusiastic adopter,\\u2019 \\u2018tech laggard,\\u2019 and \\u2018value seeker.\\u2019 the result of this study is expected to help the hotel industry to better target potential customers by understanding the different types of users of robotic technology.\",\"stand by me: analyzing the tourist\\u2013intelligent voice assistant relationship quality. purpose: this paper aims to explore tourist perceived value and attachment to intelligent voice assistants (ivas) as antecedents of the quality of the human\\u2013iva relationship in the hospitality domain. this research also examines the moderating role of psychological factors (self-esteem) and knowledge factors (past experience and technology expertise) in the relationships between antecedents and relationship quality. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the researchers conducted two quantitative studies, collecting data via online surveys in mechanical turk (n1 = 124 and n2 = 281). the proposed model was tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling. findings: the first study uncovers that tourist perceived value is the main influence on the quality of the relationship between tourists and ivas. the second study confirms the direct relationships of the first and shows that self-esteem and technology expertise act as moderators. practical implications: this study advances the understanding of the tourism and hospitality stakeholders in using modern technologies (e.g. ivas). through comprehending the relationship building between individuals and ivas, the stakeholders will be able to craft better strategies. originality\\u002fvalue: the study extends the attachment and social exchange theories to the tourist\\u2013iva relationship context. specifically, this research demonstrates the impact of tourist perceived value on the quality of the relationship with the iva. it also points out that tourists\\u2019 self-esteem and technology expertise can weaken the tourist\\u2013iva relationship.\",\"value of social robots in services: social cognition perspective. purpose: the technological revolution in the service sector is radically changing the ways in

develops a conceptual understanding of the value co-creation\\u002fdestruction potential of social robots in services. findings: three theoretical propositions construct an iterative framework of users\\u2019 evaluations of social robots in services. first, social robots offer users value propositions leveraging affective and cognitive resources. second, users\\u2019 personal values become salient through interactions with social robots\\u2019 affective and cognitive resources. third, users evaluate social robots\\u2019 value co-creation\\u002fdestruction potential according to social cognition dimensions. originality\\u002fvalue: social robots in services are an emerging topic in service research and hold promising implications for organizations and users. this relevant, conceptually robust framework advances scholarly understanding of their opportunities and pitfalls for realizing value. this study also identifies guidelines for service managers for designing and introducing social robots into complex service environments.\",\"what do hotel employees think about service robots? a qualitative study in turkey. this study aims to determine turkish hotel employees' perceptions towards service robots. data were collected through 40 in-depth interviews with hotel employees from different departments. data were analysed through thematic analysis. the results revealed that the word \\u201crobot\\u201d evoked negative emotions for hotel employees. while the hotel employees think that service robots may provide different benefits and advantages for employees and businesses, they also believe that service robots may create some problems during communication with the customers. the hotel employees also think that service robots would lead to an increased unemployment rate in the future.\",\"robot vs human: expectations, performances and gaps in off-premise restaurant service modes. purpose: off-premise restaurant service has a new addition \\u2013 food delivery robots. this new technology and off-premise service, in general, has received little research attention, despite continued year-over-year sales growth for both carry-out and delivery. therefore, this study aims to analyze off-premise service modes, including food delivery robots, for service quality gaps between consumer expectations and actual performance and among the various modes. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: performance of three off-premise restaurant service modes (robot-delivery, human-delivery and carry-out) were evaluated using a mixed-methods approach. consumer expectations were ascertained about food- and service-related performance factors using a survey, and a field observation study was conducted to obtain actual performance data for these factors. findings from both approaches were compared to identify gaps and differences. findings: for food-related performance, consumers reported lower expectations for food safety and food quality from robot- and human-delivered food; however, no differences were observed among the three modes in the field study. consumers also expected lower service-related performance from robot-delivery for service efficiency and ease of use (than human-delivery and carry-out) and monetary value (than carry-out). consumers deemed robots the most sustainable and human-delivery the most convenient compared to other modes \\u2013 however, not all service-related expectations aligned with actual performances. originality\\u002fvalue: this study was the first to comparatively examine off-premise restaurant service. identification of a missing link in service gap analysis was among the theoretical contributions of this study. managerially, this study provides previously unavailable insights into opportunities for improvement for off-premise service and use of delivery robots.\",\"spicing up hospitality service encounters: the case of pepper\\u2122. purpose: this paper aims to explore the implications of integrating humanoid service robots into hospitality service encounters by evaluating two service prototypes using softbank robotics\\u2019 popular service robot pepper\\u2122: to provide information (akin to a receptionist) and to facilitate order-taking (akin to a server). drawing both studies together, the paper puts forward novel, theory-informed yet context-rooted design principles for humanoid robot adoption in hospitality service encounters. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: adopting a multiple method qualitative approach, two service prototypes are evaluated with hospitality and tourism experts (n = 30, prototype 1) and frontline hospitality employees (n = 18, prototype 2) using participant observation, in situ feedback, semi-structured interviews and photo-elicitation. findings: the adoption of humanoid service robots in hospitality is influenced by the following four layers of determinants: contextual, social, interactional and psychological factors, as well as extrinsic and intrinsic drivers of adoption. these empirical findings both confirm and extend previous conceptualizations of human-robot interaction (hri) in hospitality service. research limitations\\u002fimplications: despite using photo-elicitation to evoke insight regarding the use of different types of service robots in hospitality, the paper mostly focuses on anthropomorphized service robots such as pepper\\u2122. practical implications: adopting humanoid service robots will transform hospitality operations, whereby the most routine, unpleasant tasks such as taking repeat orders or dealing with complaints may be delegated to service robots or human-robot teams. social implications: working with and receiving service from pepper\\u2122 changes the service encounter from direct practical, technical considerations to more nuanced social and psychological implications, particularly around feelings of self-esteem, social pressure and social judgment. originality\\u002fvalue: this paper presents one of the first empirical studies on hri in hospitality service encounters using softbank robotics\\u2019 pepper\\u2122. in doing so, the paper presents a novel framework for service robot adoption rooted in first-hand user interaction as opposed to previous, theory-driven conceptualizations of behavior or empirical studies exploring behavioral intention.\",\"leveraging \\u201chuman-likeness\\u201d of robotic service at restaurants. despite the rise of human-robot interaction research, the mixed findings of human-likeness in consumer evaluation exist. focusing on the restaurant sector, this research investigates how service robots\\u2019 varying levels of human-likeness of attributes (i.e., visual, vocal and verbal) influence consumption outcomes (e.g., service encounter evaluation, revisit intentions and positive word of mouth intentions) and the underlying mechanisms through cognition (i.e., perceived credibility) and positive emotion per appraisal theory. drawing on a consumer experiment involving a total of 587 participants, results suggest that humanlike voice emerges as a dominant attribute affecting all three consumption outcomes. humanlike language style positively affects service encounter evaluation but barely affects the other two outcomes. the significant effect of humanlike voice on three consumption outcomes is only explained by positive emotion whereas the effect of humanlike language style on service encounter evaluation is explained by both cognition (i.e., perceived credibility) and emotion.\",\"robot with humanoid hands cooks food better?: effect of robotic chef anthropomorphism on food quality prediction. purpose: robotic chefs are starting to replace human chefs in restaurant industry. whether customers have a good food quality prediction may have an important effect on their patronage decision. based on the stereotype content model, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of robotic chef anthropomorphism on food quality prediction through warmth and competence. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: an empirical analysis was done to test the theoretical model by using the smartpls software. a nonhuman-like robotic chef and a robotic chef with humanoid hands were used as background materials in the questionnaire. the effective sample was 221. findings: robotic chef anthropomorphism affects food quality prediction through the sequential mediators of warmth and competence. age is a significant control variable. research limitations\\u002fimplications: robotic chef anthropomorphism positively affects food quality prediction. the halo effect of warmth perception on competence perception should be considered in the context of robot anthropomorphism. practical implications: restaurants which feature robotic chefs should use robotic chefs with anthropomorphic designs and promote the anthropomorphic elements of robotic chefs in advertisements. social implications: the anthropomorphic design of robot chefs will facilitate the development of artificial intelligence in restaurants in the future. originality\\u002fvalue: to the best of the authors\\u2019 knowledge, this paper is one of the first to focus on how robotic chef anthropomorphism affects food quality prediction and reveals the roles of warmth and competence in the influence of robotic chef anthropomorphism on food quality prediction.\",\"service robots in hotels: understanding the service quality perceptions of human-robot interaction. hotel industry started to adopt service robots, which are considered a future workforce. however, no attempt was conducted to examine the dimensionality of service quality of service robots. this paper aims to understand the influence of human\\u2013robot interaction from the viewpoint of hoteliers and guests. two studies are conducted in this respect. study 1 organizes focus-group interviews with hotel managers from various departments to elicit themes related to guest\\u2013robot interaction and robot-delivered services. based on the findings in study 1, study 2 conducts an experiment to examine and compare hotel guests\\u2019 perceptions about the quality of services provided by human staff and service robots, as well as their joint services. human staff services are perceived higher than the services of service robots in terms of interaction quality and physical service environment. however, no significant difference in outcome quality is noted.\",\"robots or frontline employees? exploring customers\\u2019 attributions of responsibility and stability after service failure or success. purpose: service robots are taking over the organizational frontline. despite a recent surge in studies on this topic, extant works are predominantly conceptual in nature. the purpose of this paper is to provide valuable empirical insights by building on the attribution theory. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: two vignette-based experimental studies were employed. data were collected from us respondents who were randomly assigned to scenarios focusing on a hotel\\u2019s reception service and restaurant\\u2019s waiter service. findings: results indicate that respondents make stronger attributions of responsibility for the service performance toward humans than toward robots, especially when a service failure occurs. customers thus attribute responsibility to the firm rather than the frontline robot. interestingly, the perceived stability of the performance is greater when the service is conducted by a robot than by an employee. this implies that customers expect employees to shape up after a poor service encounter but expect little improvement in robots\\u2019 performance over time. practical implications: robots are perceived to be more representative of a firm than employees. to avoid harmful customer attributions, service providers should clearly communicate to customers that frontline robots pack sophisticated analytical, rather than simple mechanical, artificial intelligence technology that explicitly learns from service failures. originality\\u002fvalue: customer responses to frontline robots have remained largely unexplored. this paper is the first to explore the attributions that customers make when they experience robots in the frontline.\",\"tourists\\u2019 perceptions regarding the use of anthropomorphic robots in tourism and hospitality. purpose: amidst the covid-19 outbreak, service organizations rushed to deploy robots to serve people in quarantine, again igniting the ongoing dispute regarding robots in tourism. this study aims to investigate tourists\\u2019 perceptions regarding the use of robots and, more specifically, anthropomorphic robots in the tourism domain. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a qualitative inquiry was used to delve deep into the issue of tourists\\u2019 perceptions regarding the usage of anthropomorphic robots in tourism, with a total number of 78 interviews with tourists being retained in the study. findings: the findings reveal that tourists favor the use of anthropomorphic robots over any other type of robot. the use of anthropomorphic robots in tourism may result in an overall enhanced experiential value. even so, informants also expressed frustration, sadness and disappointment vis-\\u00e0-vis the use of robots in a human-driven industry. research limitations\\u002fimplications: a conceptual continuum of tourists\\u2019 perceptions and concerns over the use of robots is presented that can guide future studies. tourism stakeholders may look at the possibility of incorporating carefully designed anthropomorphic robots in key service positions, but should not give the impression that robots are replacing the human face of the organization. practical implications: tourism stakeholders may look at the possibility of incorporating carefully designed anthropomorphic robots in key service positions, but should not give the impression that robots are replacing the human face of the organization. originality\\u002fvalue: tourism organizations that make use of robots run the risk of being perceived as nonanthropocentric. this leads to the conclusion that anthropomorphism could be used but should not replace the sector\\u2019s anthropocentrism. the study conveys tourists\\u2019 concerns over technological (robot) determinism.\",\"the power of head tilts: gender and cultural differences of perceived human vs human-like robot smile in service. purpose: the purpose of this study is to understand the perceptual differences toward smiling behaviors with head inclinations displaying by the human-like robot staff and human staff in a service setting. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this study adopted a 2 (staff: robot\\u002fhuman personal personnel) \\u00d7 3 (head tilt: left\\u002fright\\u002fstraight) full factorial design, while cross-examining participants\\u2019 cultural dimensions 2 (power distance: high\\u002flower) \\u00d7 2 (gender: male\\u002ffemale) during the service encounter. findings: overall, it was found that male and female customers with different cultural background would perceive robot and human personnel with varying degrees of head tilt very differently, namely, regarding interpersonal warmth but not customer satisfaction. originality\\u002fvalue: nonverbal cues serve as important elements in the interaction. this paper provides new directions on the design of anthropomorphic robot and gives insight to people\\u2019s perceptual differences. all in all, the present study is useful in facilitating human\\u2013robot interactions.\",\"impacts of service robots on service quality. with rapid advances in technologies, especially in artificial intelligence, smart sensors, big data analytics, and robotics, the service industry began introducing robots to perform a variety of functions. while the main purpose of deploying robots has been productivity improvement, the current covid-19 pandemic has brought more urgent purpose, providing contactless service for social distancing. this study explores the service quality provided by robots based on real data in a hotel setting. a sample of 201 guests provided their expected service quality by robots and the actual performance experience after the service. we analyzed this relationship using importance performance analysis (ipa) and the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (topsis). the results revealed that customers\\u2019 top priorities for robots\\u2019 service quality are assurance and reliability, while tangible and empathy were not as important. customers were not satisfied with robots\\u2019 responsiveness, but this construct was found to be a low priority.\",\"public and private value creation using artificial intelligence: an empirical study of ai voice robot users in chinese public sector. despite significant theoretical and empirical attention on public value creation in the public sector, the relationship between artificial intelligence (ai) use and value creation from the citizen perspective remains poorly understood. we ground our study in moore's public value management to examine the relationship between ai use and value creation. we conceptually categorize public service value into public value and private value. we use procedural justice and trust in government as indicators of public value and, based on motivation theory, we use perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment as indicators of private value. a field survey of 492 ai voice robot users in china was conducted to test our model. the results indicated that the effective use of ai voice robots was significantly associated with private value and procedural justice. however, the relationship between the effective use of ai and trust in government was not found to be significant. surprisingly, the respondents indicated that private value had a greater effect on overall value creation than public value. this contrasts with the common idea that value creation from the government perspective suggests that social objectives requiring public value are more important to citizens. the results also show that gender and citizens with different experiences show different ai usage behaviors.\",\"understanding consumers\\u2019 acceptance of automated technologies in service encounters: drivers of digital voice assistants adoption. customers increasingly orchestrate their everyday activities with the support of technology, with services increasingly adopting ai-based applications. yet, research is still in its infancy and has been largely conceptual. therefore, based on data collected from 238 young consumers, analyzed using pls-sem, this study focuses on users\\u2019 motivations to adopt intelligent digital voice assistants in service encounters. findings show that functional, social and relational elements drive adoption, untangle crossover effects between them and reveal the moderating role of experience and need for human interaction. while empirically validating and extending the service robot acceptance model by wirtz and colleagues, this study provides evidence that anthropomorphism is not universally positive and adds a new perspective regarding the underexplored role of customer-robot rapport building. the study contributes to a more holistic understanding of digital voice assistants\\u2019 adoption and provides managerial guidance on how to successfully implement such technologies.\",\"the adoption of artificial intelligence and robotics in the hotel industry: prospects and challenges. the growth of technology has resulted in the use of state-of-the-art systems such as artificial intelligence (ai) and robot-based applications and services in the hotel industry. recently, there has been some discussion on the adoption of such technologies and their impact on hotels\\u2019 operational costs as well as the quality of service to customers. considering the importance of these new technologies, this paper investigates the trend related to the adoption of ai and robotics in the hotel industry. for this purpose, we interviewed senior hotel asset managers using an in-depth case study method. the context is dubai-based hotels as dubai is already established as one of the premier smart cities of the world (khan et al., 2017). the toe framework was used, and three domains were investigated: technology, organization, and environment to expose the underlying factors effecting ai adoption. the findings expose the factors that influence the adoption of ai and robotics in hotels. this study is one of early attempts to investigate the full spectrum of ai in relation to the hotel industry while detailing how its adoption could be effectuated.\",\"examining the effects of robots' physical appearance, warmth, and competence in frontline services: the humanness-value-loyalty model. because of continuous improvements in their underlying technologies, customers perceive frontline robots as social actors with a high level of humanness, both in appearance and behavior. advancing from mere theoretical contributions to this study field, this article proposes and empirically validates the humanness-value-loyalty model (hvl model). this study analyzes to what extent robots' perceived physical human-likeness, perceived competence, and perceived warmth affect customers' service value expectations and, subsequently, their loyalty intentions. following two pretests to select the most suitable robots and ensure scenario realism, data were collected by means of a vignette experimental study and analyzed using the partial least squares method. the results reveal that human-likeness positively affects four dimensions of service value expectations. perceived competence of the robot influences mainly utilitarian expectations (i.e., functional and monetary value), while perceived warmth influences relational expectations (i.e., emotional value). interestingly, and contrary to theoretical predictions, the influence of the robot's warmth on service value expectations is more pronounced for customers with a lower need for social interaction. in sum, this study contributes to a better understanding of customers' reactions to artificial intelligence-enabled technologies with humanized cognitive capabilities and also suggests interesting research avenues to advance on this emerging field.\",\"willingness-to-pay for robot-delivered tourism and hospitality services \\u2013 an exploratory study. purpose: this paper aims to investigate potential consumers\\u2019 willingness to pay for robot-delivered services in travel, tourism and hospitality, and the factors that shape their willingness to pay. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: an online survey yielded a sample of 1,573 respondents from 99 countries. independent samples t-test, analysis of variance (anova), cluster, factor and regression analyses were used. findings: respondents expected to pay less for robot-delivered services than human-delivered services. two clusters were identified: one cluster willing to pay nearly the same price for robotic services as for human-delivered services, whilst the other expected deep discounts for robotic services. the willingness-to-pay was positively associated with the attitudes towards robots in tourism, robotic service experience expectations, men and household size. it was negatively associated to travel frequency, age and education. research limitations\\u002fimplications: the paper\\u2019s main limitation is its exploratory nature and the use of a hypothetical scenario in measuring respondents\\u2019 willingness to pay. the data were gathered prior to the covid-19 pandemic and do not reflect the potential changes in perceptions of robots due to the pandemic. practical implications: practitioners need to focus on improving the attitudes towards robots in tourism because they are strongly and positively related to the willingness to pay. the marketing messages need to form positive expectations about robotic services. originality\\u002fvalue: this is one of the first papers to investigate consumers\\u2019 willingness to pay for robot-delivered services in travel, tourism and hospitality and factors that shape their willingness to pay.\",\"customers\\u2019 intention to use robot-serviced restaurants in korea: relationship of coolness and mci factors. purpose: this study aims to empirically test a theoretical model by defining customers\\u2019 intention to use services of restaurant robots, which are rapidly developing in korea. the proposed model incorporates three stages: coolness, motivated consumer innovativeness (mci) and the theory of planned behaviour. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a total of 420 questionnaires were issued. the results were analysed to verify the reliability and validity of the measured variables. structural equation modelling was used to test the research hypotheses. findings: the results showed that hedonically motivated consumer innovativeness (hmci) and socially motivated consumer innovativeness (smci) have positive effects on attitude and are enhanced by attractiveness, utility, subcultural appeal and originality. however, the relationship between mci and attitude differed among age groups. practical implications: the results revealed that sensory elements of robot services improve customer attitudes towards the use of robots in restaurants. this is a key finding that restaurant marketers should consider, because non-face-to-face services are becoming increasingly important in the current covid-19 context. originality\\u002fvalue: this study analysed the relationship between coolness, mci and the theory of planned behaviour in the context of robot-serviced restaurants and how the relationship between mcis and attitude differed among the young and older customers. practical implications are suggested.\",\"brave new world: service robots in the frontline. purpose: the service sector is at an inflection point with regard to

will have a significant influence on travel, tourism and hospitality (tth) globally. with a massive reduction in tourism globally because of the health crisis, the industry will have to plan recovery and rebuilding of the industry with greater consideration of the biosecurity of customers. a critical element in the reorganisation of the industry will involve the increased incorporation of automation technologies. this article adopts a supply-side perspective and elaborates on the opportunities that automation technologies provide to tth companies to mitigate the negative impacts of biosecurity threats on their economic performance. it discusses the costs and benefits of the incorporation of increased levels of automation, especially in regard to the benefits of the safety and health of the consumer. it elaborates on how the current pandemic would stimulate the adoption of automation technologies. finally, the article discusses how this fit into the business models of tourism-related industries and outlines the micro- and macroeconomic implications of the greater incorporation of automation into the industry.\",\"impact of anthropomorphic features of artificially intelligent service robots on consumer acceptance: moderating role of sense of humor. purpose: this study aims to investigate the impact of both physical and personality-related anthropomorphic features of an artificial intelligence service robot on the cognitive and affective appraisals and acceptance of consumers during service delivery. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: the proposed hypotheses that investigate the effects of service robots\\u2019 physical appearance on the emphasis consumers place on each evaluation criteria they use in determining their willingness to accept the use of service robots in service delivery and the moderating role of sense of humor are tested by conducting two studies using scenario-based experiments. findings: the results show that humanlike appearance leads to higher performance expectancy, mascot-like appearance generates higher positive emotions and machine-like appearance results in higher effort expectancy. the effects of humanlike and mascot-like appearances on consumer acceptance are moderated by the sense of humor of service robots. however, the sense of humor effect is attenuated with a machine-like appearance owing to the lack of anthropomorphism. practical implications: this study provides crucial insights for hospitality managers who plan to use service robots in service delivery. the findings highlight the key roles of appearance type and sense of humor of service robots in influencing the appraisals and acceptance of consumers regarding the use of service robots in service delivery. originality\\u002fvalue: this study focuses on comparing the effects of traditional and mascot-like appearances of service robots on consumer appraisals and identifies sense of humor as a cute anthropomorphized personality trait of service robots.\",\"how will service robots redefine leadership in hotel management? a delphi approach. purpose: using the delphi technique, this paper aims to investigate how human resource experts perceive service robots will impact leadership and human resource management in the hospitality industry. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: a three-stage delphi study with hotel industry human resource experts was conducted to identify the key trends and major challenges that will emerge in the next ten years and how leaders should deal with the challenges brought about by service robot technologies. findings: the results show that while service robots are anticipated to increase efficiency and productivity of hotel activities, they may also pose challenges such as high costs, skill deficits and significant changes to the organizational structure and culture of hotels. therefore, the anticipated applications and integration of robotic technology will require leaders of the future to carefully consider the balance between the roles of service robots and human employees in the guest experience and to nurture a work environment that embraces open-mindedness and change. originality\\u002fvalue: this is the first type of study to examine hospitality leadership and human resource management in the context of robotized hotels. this study has taken an important step to understand the leadership role in robotized hotels from a human resource perspective and brings clarity as to how robotic technology can influence leadership in the future workplace.\",\"service robots: applying social exchange theory to better understand human\\u2013robot interactions. despite service robots' importance in the tourism industry, few studies have investigated human\\u2013robot interaction from a reciprocal exchange perspective. this paper applies social exchange theory to the context of human\\u2013robot interaction along with relational and psychological states based on two empirical studies with two service robots (i.e., pepper and connie) in hotel settings. findings reveal significant positive effects of perceived intelligence, perceived social presence, and perceived social interactivity on trust, leading to usage intentions. similarly, perceived social presence and perceived social interactivity are positively related to rapport, driving usage intentions. perceived intelligence and perceived social interactivity negatively lead to uniqueness neglect to contribute to usage intentions. we additionally identify mediating roles of rapport, trust, and uniqueness neglect in the relationships between human\\u2013robot attributes and usage intentions. our results deliver key insight into how human\\u2013robot interaction attributes influence users\\u2019 relational and psychological states and subsequent usage intentions.\",\"human staff vs. service robot vs. fellow customer: does it matter who helps your customer following a service failure incident?. the key to excellent service delivery is to ensure harmonious interactions between service actors. therefore, in the event of service failure incidents, an understanding of the roles and interactions of these service actors is critical to achieving positive service outcomes. this research addresses the question: how do interactions between customers and these service actors (human staff\\u002fautomated technological interface\\u002ffellow customer) influence their service experience following a service failure? we draw on role theory and answer this question via three experimental studies. findings show that customers evaluate their service experience less favourably when receiving service recovery from fellow customers rather than firms (human staff and service robots). furthermore, a firm's instrumental recovery, rather than informational recovery, leads to a more favourable service evaluation, although this effect is absent when service

perspective: a mixed-method approach. service robots (sr) are increasingly valued and embraced; they are here to stay. research on collaborative intelligence to better understand robotic-human partnerships is scarce. to bridge that gap this study aimed to examine the value of sr from the guest's perspective, thus gain a deeper understanding of the co-value creation process in the context of full-service hotels. a mixed-method design was used to capture the depth and breadth of perceived value of sr. study 1 is a qualitative study probing consumers\\u2019 sense making regarding sr. study 2 used structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses derived from study 1. results indicate that perceived privacy, functional benefits of sr, and robot appearance positively influence consumers\\u2019 attitude towards adoption of sr. functional benefits and novelty had an impact on the individuals\\u2019 anticipated overall experience. attitude and anticipated overall experience, in turn, enhanced consumers\\u2019 acceptance of sr. implications, limitations, and future research are discussed.\",\"service robots in the hospitality industry: the case of henn-na hotel, japan. services are changing at an impressive pace boosted by the technological advances felt in robotics, big data, and artificial intelligence (ai) that have uncovered new research opportunities. our objective is to contribute to the literature by exploring the pros and cons of the use of service robots in the hospitality industry and to practice, by presenting the architectural and technological characteristics of a fully automated plant based on a relevant case. to achieve such goal, this article uses a systematic literature review to assess the state-of-the-art, characterize the unit of analysis, and find new avenues for further research. the results indicate that, in high customer contact settings, service robots tend to outperform humans when performing standardized tasks, because of their mechanical and analytical nature. evidence also shows that, in some cases, service robots have not yet achieved the desired technological maturity to proficiently replace humans. in other words, the technology is not quite there yet, but this does not contradict the fact that new robot technologies, enabled by ai, will be able to replace the employees\\u2019 empathetic intelligence. in practical terms, organizations are facing challenges where they have to decide whether service robots are capable of completely replacing human labor or if they should rather invest in balanced options, such as human-robot systems, that seem to be a much more rational choice today.\",\"frontline service technology infusion: conceptual archetypes and future research directions. purpose: smart technologies and connected objects are rapidly changing the organizational frontline. yet, our understanding of how these technologies infuse service encounters remains limited. therefore, the purpose of this paper is to update existing classifications of frontline service technology (fst) infusion. moreover, the authors discuss three promising smart and connected technologies \\u2013 conversational agents, extended reality (xr) and blockchain technology \\u2013 and their respective implications for customers, frontline employees and service organizations. design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach: this paper uses a conceptual approach integrating existing work on fst infusion with artificial intelligence, robotics, xr and blockchain literature, while also building on insights gathered through expert interviews and focus group conversations with members of two service research centers. findings: the authors define fst and propose a set of fst infusion archetypes at the organizational frontline. additionally, the authors develop future research directions focused on understanding how conversational agents, xr and blockchain technology will impact service. originality\\u002fvalue: this paper updates and extends existing classifications of fst, while paving the road for further work on fst infusion.\",\"enhancing hospitality experience with service robots: the mediating role of rapport building. this study investigated the influence of service robot attributes on customers\\u2019 hospitality experience from the perspective of relationship building. through literature review and a preliminary study with in-depth interviews, a conceptual framework was developed. a scenario-based experiment and questionnaire survey were designed to test the model. the results indicate that robots\\u2019 being perceived as humanlike or intelligent positively affects customer-robot rapport building and the hospitality experience. additionally, customer-employee rapport building was found to mediate the relationship between robot attributes and the hospitality experience, but customer-robot rapport building was not. based on these findings, theoretical contributions and practical implications were discussed.\",\"applications and implications of service robots in hospitality. service robots continue to permeate and automate the hospitality sector. in doing so, these technological innovations pose to radically change current service production and delivery practices and, consequently, service management and marketing strategies. this study explores the various impacts of robotization in the sector by offering one of the first empirical accounts on the current state-of-the-art of service robotics as deployed in hospitality service encounters. the results suggest that service robots either support or substitute employees in service encounters. they also offer hospitality businesses a novel point of differentiation, but only if properly integrated as part of wider marketing efforts. finally, the automation of tasks, processes, and, ultimately, jobs has serious socioeconomic implications both at the microlevel and macrolevel. consequently, hospitality executives need to consider where and how to apply robotization to strike a balance between operational efficiency and customer expectations. displaying ethical leadership is key to reaping the benefits of the robot revolution.\",\"check-in at the robo-desk: effects of automated social presence on social cognition and service implications. the rise of humanoid robots in hospitality services accelerates the need to understand related consumer reactions. four scenario-based experiments, building on social presence and social cognition theories, examine how humanoid robots (vs. self-service machines) shape consumer service perceptions vis-\\u00e0-vis concurrent presence\\u002fabsence of human staff. the influence of consumers' need for human interaction and technology readiness is also examined. we find that anthropomorphizing service robots positively affects expected service quality, first-visit intention, willingness to pay, as well as increasing warmth\\u002fcompetence inferences. however, these effects are contingent on the absence of human frontline staff, explained by viewing anthropomorphism as a relative concept. humanoid robots increase psychological risk, but this poses no threat to expected service quality when consumers' need for human interaction is controlled for. additionally, we show that a humanoid robot's effect on expected service quality is positive for all but low technology readiness levels. further implications for theory\\u002fpractice are discussed.\",\"turning robotic

I want you to identify the reearch topic of following documents, which are titles plus abstacts of scientific journal article publications. They are representative articles for the topic to be identified. The journal is called  'Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions'. The journal offers a platform for reporting studies of innovations and socio-economic transitions to enhance an environmentally sustainable economy and thus solve structural resource scarcity and environmental problems, notably related to fossil energy use and climate change. This involves attention for technological, organizational, economic, institutional and political innovations as well as economy-wide and sector changes, such as in the areas of energy, transport, agriculture and water management. The journal aims to tackle the most difficult questions, dealing with social, economic, behavioral-psychological and political barriers and opportunities as well as their complex interaction. The journal is multidisciplinary in spirit and methodologically open, and invites contributions from a broad range of disciplines within the social, environmental and innovation sciences. Specific research areas covered include: Theoretical analysis, formal modeling, empirical studies, policy discussion and a critical survey of relevant literature. Practical cases may address transitions in specific sectors, cities or regions. Articles on historical transitions not specifically related to environment and sustainability are welcome if they include a section with unique lessons for sustainability transitions. A non-exhaustive list of keywords and themes is as follows: behavior in line with bounded rationality, development theories, diffusion of innovations, environmental regulation, formal modeling, geography of innovations, historical transitions, increasing returns to scale and path dependence, innovation policy, institutional barriers, international cooperation and coordination, learning-by-doing, learning curves, lock-in, new governance, niche markets, optimal technological diversity, regime analysis, social and political power, strategic niche management, rebound effect, recombinant innovation, sector structure, social learning, transition experiments, technological regimes, transition pathways/mechanisms, vested interests, visions of the future.\"\n",
