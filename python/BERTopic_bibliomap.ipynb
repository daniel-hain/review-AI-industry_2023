[{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"looking beyond the hype: conditions affecting the promise of behaviour change apps as social innovations for low-carbon transitions. digital tools, specifically smartphone apps, have emerged as enablers of social innovation for low-carbon transitions by using novel feedback to creatively engage people to act more sustainably, and thus capture the power of collective individual action. such apps have increasingly been implemented in real-world experiments with positive results in the short-term. however critical reflection is required to look beyond this hype to understand the conditions for longer term impact, thus reaching a transformative social innovation potential. in this paper, we take two exemplary behaviour change apps and perform a cost-benefit analysis to assess the break-even point in number of users to achieve net-positive impact and discuss relevant technical, organisational, political and financial conditions that enable or impede this impact. we find that the required scale-up in users seems challenging, yet feasible. however, guaranteeing that the supportive conditions are available is necessary to warrant the focus on behaviour change apps by research and policy.\",\"a transition to an innovative and inclusive bioeconomy in aragon, spain. this research proposes a theoretical framework to reflect on bioeconomic transitions, which, in turn, is tested by a case study of innovative and inclusive socio-institutional practices in the context of a spanish region, aragon. this integrative proposal places the individual and the community at the core and considers a variety of spaces, levels, scales and actions for understanding the redefinition of individual and organisational roles involved in the bioeconomic proposal. it concludes that innovation and inclusion are crosscutting concepts and practices that are indispensable for developing social skills, community resilience and business activity and essential for tackling global and local challenges. we also highlight private sector efforts to make headway with transition at a time when the definition of future policy strategies is ambiguous.\",\"understanding the transition to integrated flood risk management in the netherlands. the multi-pattern approach (mpa) is a new method that has been applied to understand the transition to integrated flood risk management (ifrm) in the netherlands. this paper presents a detailed analysis of the outcomes of the 2.3 billion euro flood safety programme room for the river (rftr). 2 years of research, 55 interviews, a survey of 155 respondents and elaborate document analysis, provided in-depth evidence of how the transition occurred in practice. experiments were scaled-up, ifrm was consolidated in national policies, and the implementation of rftr further adapted the functioning of the societal system. lessons are drawn that enrich the mpa framework and that can help its further development and application. the mpa provides scientists with a method to analyse transition dynamics as a chain of patterns that occur under certain conditions. policy makers can shape and monitor the outcomes that are to be generated to support a transition.\",\"niche construction, innovation and complexity. niche construction is the process of environmental modification by organisms. by transforming natural selection pressures, niche construction generates feedback in evolution at various different levels. niche-constructing species play important ecological roles by creating habitats and resources used by other species and thereby affecting the flow of energy and matter through ecosystems (ecosystem engineering) and can be a source of legacy effects to descendant populations (ecological inheritance). niche construction theory (nct) emphasizes how acquired characters play an evolutionary role through transforming selective environments, a point germane to human evolution, where we see extensive environmental modification through cultural practices. theoretical findings stemming from population-genetic and population-ecology modelling of niche construction suggest that niche construction can be a source of evolutionary innovation and stability, and can generate unusual evolutionary dynamics, such as time-lagged (i.e. inertia, momentum) and autocatalytic responses to selection, and coevolutionary feedback between levels (e.g. gene-culture coevolution). similar dynamics are predicted in analogous cultural systems subject to human niche construction. here we present an accessible introduction to nct and then briefly reflect on how it might be used to study human innovation and complex systems.\",\"narratives of biorefinery innovation for the bioeconomy: conflict, consensus or confusion?. transition narratives are stories promoting particular pathways for development, promoting specific actions, strategies, and interventions to enable certain outcomes in socio-technical transitions. narratives centered around biorefineries take a significant role in the growing bioeconomy discourse, yet they express remarkably different visions for the transition. the paper uses q methodology to identify and analyse transition narratives related to biorefinery innovation, their domains of conflict and consensus, and implications for alternative pathways of development. the analysis shows that the narratives are divided on three aspects: the significance of different kinds of products, the importance of generating new or applying current knowledge, and the need for a comprehensive agenda of state interventions to support a transition towards a bioeconomy. pathways to very different bioeconomies are indeed open, but policy should remain attentive to the existing conflicts and not presume consensus among actors who claim to support innovation for a bioeconomy.\",\"articulations of mundane transition work among consulting engineers. this paper analyses sustainability transition agency among consulting engineers, who exercise considerable influence in a wide spectrum of environmental decision-making through advice, calculations and design. they work in an ambiguous space of governmental requirements, environmental politics, cost considerations, and professional standards. nevertheless, many consulting engineers engage with sustainability transitions in a mundane and modest way. to a varying degree, they combine four kinds of transition work: (1) sustainable technological problem solving, (2) persuasion work, (3) mediation work, and (4) institutional work. on this basis, we propose a model of sustainability transition agency where sustainable technological problem solving is the core activity as a precondition of necessary sociotechnical change. the three latter kinds of transition work may facilitate and support the core activity. the study also shows that environmental regulations, rules and standards are important to sustainability transition work among consulting engineers, guiding but also providing more space for such efforts.\",\"towards a political ecology of the digital economy: socio-environmental implications of two competing value models. this article explores the socio-environmental implications of two different value models currently competing for dominance in the digital economy: the neo-feudal cognitive capitalism (nfcc) and the hypothetical case of mature peer production (hmpp). using a systematisation that considers environmental effects of information and communication technologies as direct, indirect and structural, this article discerns the future socio-environmental scenarios indicative of each value model. we argue that the two value models share the same type of direct environmental effects associated with a similar technological infrastructure; however, their indirect effects differ in prospects of consumer behaviour, environmental awareness and product design. likewise the difference in structural effects is significant as the nfcc is based on profit maximisation and an accumulation of capital, whereas the hmpp is agnostic to growth and oriented towards the commons. hence, the latter is considered as the socio-environmentally auspicious choice, but comes not without transitional challenges of its own.\",\"a spatial whole systems justice approach to sustainability transitions. in the ten years of environmental innovation and societal transitions publishing, sustainability transitions have advanced in some domains, yet much remains to be done. for these transitions to grow, accelerate, and be socially accepted, our research needs to integrate an intentionally spatial whole systems justice approach that combines thinking from justice, geography and existing transition frameworks. using examples from the energy, transport, fashion and food sectors, we call for sustainability transitions research to reveal, consider and mitigate injustices that can occur across the entire chain of innumerate inherently global systems.\",\"transforming dumps into gold mines. experiences from swedish case studies. this article discusses the transformation of landfills from dumps to an alchemist's dream - gold mines - by highlighting five swedish case studies where the landfill has been extracted. it is shown that landfills are embedded in broader socio-technical systems, including technology, policies, culture, norms, markets, and networks. these artifacts have aligned into mutual dependencies under the notion that landfills are garbage dumps, which has entrapped the landfill in the prevailing \\\"dump regime\\\". at the present time there is a window of opportunity to escape the \\\"dump regime.\\\" dumps are being challenged by the circular economy, which has established instability in the regime. however, for landfills to transform into \\\"gold mines\\\" creative entrepreneurs with the capacity to understand the emergent properties of deposition - i.e. giving rise to a resource base - will be key. for further transformation, specialized mining actors, collaboration and further exogenous changes such as higher metal prices are necessary.\",\"enabling a transformation to a bioeconomy in new zealand. the 2009 oecd call for a global transition towards a bioeconomy has resulted in a number of nations adopting national or regional strategies to develop their bioeconomies. new zealand's large biological resource base and a well-established cultural heritage in farm production, including a comparative advantage in livestock production, should make it well-positioned for bioeconomy-based wealth creation. however, ecological and societal limits require the current economic farming model to be re-evaluated. we develop a bioeconomy framework, and use it to analyse where new zealand is currently positioned and what would be required for new zealand to transform into a fully functioning bioeconomy. we identify several critical elements of a bioeconomy that are either not fully developed in new zealand, or are clearly lacking, most notably finance and governance, and the need for public engagement in policy. in order for new zealand to realise the potential opportunity the bioeconomy offers, we suggest a more integrated and cohesive primary sector model that goes beyond tweaking the existing (livestock and primary production based) regime towards supporting and developing new niche production sectors, based on a clear vision jointly conceived with wider society.\",\"a possible way out of the combined economic-sustainability crisis. a viewpoint is offered on the complexities of the combined economic-sustainability crisis, and a possible way forward starting with addressing inequalities.\",\"mainstreaming solar: stretching the regulatory regime through business model innovation. this paper explores how the regulatory regime for solar pv, defined as a combination of niche shielding and mainstream regulations, affects niche business models, using the dutch and flemish regulatory regimes as examples. the regulatory regime does not influence all components of the business model: only one or two components are usually affected. the level of niche shielding influences the dominant niche empowerment strategy. we also identified substantial heterogeneity in fit-and-conform and stretch-and-transform empowerment strategies for dealing with the regulatory regime. these strategies are reflected in business models, and differ in terms of temporal focus, motivation and shielding characteristics targeted. finally, we show that business model innovation, sometimes in combination with technological innovation, can be used for stretching the regulatory regime. organizational components of the business model are usually redesigned for this purpose.\",\"brick by brick: governing industry decarbonization in the face of uncertainty and risk. basic materials such as steel and cement have been instrumental to modern society, but the production requires high energy inputs and is associated with significant co2 emissions. long investment cycles, slow turnover rate of the capital stock, and high capital intensity mean that basic materials industries are among the economic activities that will be the most difficult to decarbonize. although the importance of addressing industrial emissions has been increasingly recognized, the development of measures and technologies that could deliver deeper emissions cuts has been relatively slow. in this paper, we present a conceptual framework focusing on four categories of barriers\\u2014market, technology, regulatory, and coordination\\u2014that hamper deep decarbonization in the basic materials industries. we use the swedish basic materials industries and policy context to illustrate how the proposed framework can be understood and applied and broadly discuss policies that can facilitate the climate transition.\",\"exploring the role of failure in socio-technical transitions research. in this paper, we offer a comprehensive and interdisciplinary review of \\u2018failure\\u2019 in transitions research. what is meant by failure, and is the community biased against it? how is failure explained through different perspectives? how can failures be addressed more appropriately in transitions studies? we synthesize a large body of evidence spanning transitions studies, innovation studies, science and technology studies, organisation and management studies, policy studies and the history of technology to probe and sharpen these questions. we examine within these literatures the instances and possibilities of success with transitions and discuss why this may be problematic, organising our analysis around four types of bias (selection, cognitive, interpretive, and prescription). in addition, we review three \\u2018families\\u2019 of framings of failure put forward in and around the socio-technical transitions literature, notably discrete failure events, systemic failings and processual accounts of failure, and discuss how they can be constructively put to work.\",\"a social network analysis of germany's wood-based bioeconomy: social capital and shared beliefs. the present study undertakes a social network analysis (sna) to identify some of the main organisations involved in germany's wood-based bioeconomy (wbe) innovation system, their relationship to each other and their shared beliefs. the resulting network map shows a rather densely connected \\u201cstrategic\\u201d wbe network where actors exchange mainly information and knowledge. some 30 organisations are central to the network and act as \\u201cbrokers\\u201d connecting different segments of the network. despite weak connections, organisations report high levels of trust regarding their cooperation. most actors share similar visions about the wbe. however, the different meanings and policy preferences associated with these beliefs vary. given this low frequency of contact and the absence of a shared, common policy vision the wbe networks is less likely to initiate collective action.\",\"justice in energy transitions. this paper argues that transitions research more broadly needs to take more account of justice in its analysis. this paper draws primarily from environmental and energy justice literature to engage with the concept of justice in transitions research, as it seeks justice for people, communities, and the non-human environment from negative environmental impacts. this is achieved through different forms of justice: distributive, procedural, and recognition. our paper concludes with reflections upon the application of a justice approach to sustainability transitions research and offer insights into a potentially new research agenda.\",\"scale limits to sustainability: transdisciplinary evidence from three danish cases. scale has risen to greater prominence in the study of sustainable transitions, as efforts to understand the diffusion of innovation seeks to take account of place-specific effects. long a contested concept in geography, a transdisciplinary account of scale focuses greater attention on ways in which conditions emerge as limits to transitions when considered vertically. this article advances such an account and demonstrates the importance of the approach through three case studies in denmark: the municipality and island of sams\\u00f8 copenhagen, and the danish nation as a whole. the rise of these locales as global leaders in environmentalism obscures unsolved problems and under-emphasized caveats that in some instances appear intractable. individually, these cases raise a number of factors representing insights from different disciplinary concerns; together, the cases suggest that scale effects impose more severe constraints and even limits on the development of sustainability transitions.\",\"a report on the second international conference on sustainability transitions (2011, lund, sweden). this news item provides a brief report of the second international conference on sustainability transitions which was held in lund, sweden, june 2011.\",\"network analysis of energy transition arena experiments. this article examines energy related experiments suggested and outlined in a co-creative energy transition arena in finland in 2017 with participating experts from various spheres of society. a transition arena is a process for engaging stakeholders in systemic transitions, and experiments are an important measure for enhancing transition and mechanisms of change. we apply network analysis and use the theories of change evaluation framework to reveal the implicit expectations and change theories of the arena participants. in the analysis, we first deconstruct the experiments into their key elements and then reconstruct them in the form of visual networks, which helps us to identify what the examined experiments have in common and how their elements connect. the data visualisations of the networks further help to examine how the arena participants construct transitions in the finnish energy sector.\",\"learning to find a way out of non-sustainable systems. this article presents and illustrates an analytical framework designed to open-up the black-box of what and how people learn while trying to tackle sustainability problems and to investigate the potential of learning processes and outcomes to enable transitions. it consists of an analytical method: practical epistemology analysis, and two analytical models: transactional learning theory and the multi-level perspective on sustainability transitions. the framework is empirically illustrated with an analysis of what/how people learn through participating in workshops to develop scenarios for creating a more sustainable urban food system. the article presents three different learning situations, reveals how diverse learning processes have varied potential to enable sustainability transitions and discusses how such studies can provide guidance for improving learning in the context sustainability transitions.\",\"common-pool resources and governance in sustainability transitions. common-pool resources (cprs) are critical in sustainability transitions. they are often important means for environmental and societal innovation, and object of unsustainable extraction and governance practices. we argue why cprs and their governance matter in transitions and point to issues for further research: (i) conceptualization of sustainability and transitions in light of common-pool resources and governance; (ii) the roles, potentials, and challenges of commoning practices, beyond the market\\u2013state dichotomy; (iii) interactions between cprs and commons with markets/firms and the state/governments in processes of sustainability transitions. these overarching issues bring fresh perspectives to transitions literature: (i) cprs/commons help advance the integration between ecological and socio-technical systems (ii) non-excludable resources affect entrepreneurial activity and innovation processes in the dynamics of socio-technical system; (iii) cprs/commons add new viewpoints to the question of directionality of transitions. we conclude by advocating for building bridges with new institutional and environmental economics, and social practice theory.\",\"digitalization as a driver of transformative environmental innovation. this viewpoint argues for an explicit focus on digitalization as a key driver of transformative environmental change and innovation in the next decade. we hold that digitalization is more than a landscape concern. our piece suggests three elements of a critical approach to digitalization: to examine its ubiquitous unfolding, to study it as a real socio-material phenomenon \\u2018on the ground\\u2019, and to analyse how it enables new forms of coordination across sectors. we conclude that eist scholars must engage critically with the proliferation of digitalization in most or all societal sectors, and with how this sets directions for low-carbon transitions.\",\"pathways and harbours for the translocal diffusion of sustainability innovations in europe. sustainability challenges require experimenting with various types of sustainability innovations. local and regional context conditions influence their diffusion. our research question is: what are pathways for the transfer of sustainability innovations to other locations, and how do local and regional conditions enable this transfer? we use the notion of \\u2018harbours\\u2019 to conceptualise the combination of these conditions. in a comparative case study in four city-regions, analysing 48 experiments, we find that technological innovations travel easier around the globe compared to social innovations. for social innovations, the transferred knowledge has a more tacit character and the innovations are strongly embedded in the local cultural and institutional context. signifiers may enable their translocal diffusion. moreover, the results suggest that innovations are \\u2018translated\\u2019 rather than replicated. we find some important local and regional context conditions enabling transfer: cultural conditions, vibrant environments (such as festivals), networks and the presence of enabling regional actors.\",\"transition \\u2018backlash\\u2019: towards explanation, governance and critical understanding. transitions research needs to engage more thoroughly with relapses in transitions. particularly salient are the dynamics of \\u2018backlash\\u2019: transition trajectories that, after initial diffusion, stagnate and subsequently relapse in terms of intended system change. due to preoccupations with desirable transitions and virtuous s-curves, the phenomenon is seldom addressed head-on. this viewpoint article stresses the need for dedicated middle-range theory explanations, identifying the underlying critical conditions and social mechanisms. this would inform governance strategies to anticipate, avoid, dampen or cope with backlash. for further theory development it is useful to combine innovation-oriented transitions research with various stability-oriented strands of social theory. critical analyses of institutional contradictions, cognitive dissonance and behavioural reactance help to detect individual, organizational and systemic sources of backlash. further research crucially requires critical understanding and unpacking of the concept: resting on assumptions about system changes and time-frames, diagnoses of \\u2018backlash\\u2019 are never self-evident.\",\"the changing landscape of deep transitions: sociotechnical imprinting and chemical warfare. this paper addresses a major gap in sustainability transitions research: the role of shocks in shaping transition dynamics. the papers focuses on shocks with traumatic consequences, in particular world war i and ii. the paper revisits discussions on the sociotechnical landscape in the multi-level perspective (mlp) and deep transition framework, offering refined versions of the concepts of systemic and landscape imprinting. it proceeds with a case-study analysis focusing on niche developments during wwi in relation to chemicals and the emergence of chemical warfare, and the lasting impact this shock had on interwar developments, wwii and the post-wwii context. the collective memories of the use of chemical weapons during war and expectations around future use of chemical weapons formed a new backdrop that influenced developments in the food system. here, food became more tightly intertwined with military imperatives related to preparations regarding the use of chemical and biological weapons. this paper contributes to emerging understandings of how landscape shocks influence sociotechnical change, in particular how these shocks can lead to long lasting tight couplings between socio-technical systems. two broader research recommendations follow from it. first, more work is needed on the neglected role of war and the military in sociotechnical transitions. second, in terms of contemporary sustainability challenges, research could consider how landscape events - including the coronavirus pandemic, events related to dramatic biodiversity losses and the climate crisis as well as the traumatic experience of poverty traps and steep rising inequality - may produce trauma and new forms of shared meaning and expectations that impinge on sociotechnical change.\",\"actors in transitions: narratives of roles and change in the german e-mobility transition. we apply an approach that theoretically connects processes at different scales within a sociotechnical sustainability transitions frame, focusing on individual actors. drawing on interviews with actors involved in the electric mobility transition in lower saxony, germany, we analyse actors\\u2019 narratives as revelatory of situated or \\u2018conjunctural\\u2019 knowledge, as viewed from a strong structuration perspective of sociotechnical change. the purpose is to shed a particular type of light on structure-agency processes. strong structuration is an extended version of giddens\\u2019 social theory that takes account of actors\\u2019 subjective experience of their situation, viewing this as both shaped by - and shaping of - structure, in the sense of rules that are internal and external to individuals. here we show how actors\\u2019 narratives of their experiences and positions in the sociotechnical system reveal themes relevant to the on-going structuration electric vehicles in the case study region of lower saxony, germany. we identify general \\u2018meta-narratives\\u2019 that span more than one individual, as well as personal narratives that are specific to individuals. in addition, the analytic value of narratives in transition literature is discussed.\",\"human geography and socio-technical transition studies: promising intersections. transition researchers recognize increasingly the need to better address the role that spatial and geographical factors play in guiding the evolution of socio-technical and technological innovation systems. at the same time, some geographers are being drawn to transition studies as they strive to better understand the development trajectories of cities, industries, production networks, and economies. building off these convergences, this paper proposes two interventions through which geographical ideas might further contribute to transitions research. the first focuses on conceptualizations of the socio-spatial dynamics through which tis or niche contexts are coupled or aligned effectively with socio-technical regimes such that regime shifts become possible. the second brings the concept of place-making to bear on transition studies in order to analyze the political processes that shape the evolution of socio-technical systems. the paper closes with general arguments about ways to expand and diversify the geography-of-sustainability-transitions epistemic community.\",\"niche politics: biogas, technological flexibility and the economisation of resource recovery. the \\u2018niche\\u2019 is a central concept in sustainability transitions. however, its mobilisation in analytical practice raises two concerns. the first stems from socio-technical determinism vis-\\u00e0-vis technological flexibility and the risk that technologies become a priori linked to societal functions. the second actualises when emerging niches become framed, from the outset, in terms of their positive potential for socio-technical system change; making it difficult to ask normative questions about the dimensions that should count for transitions. using the concept of economisation, we analyse the diversity of niche configurations that all make use of the same technological core to generate economic value. we examine finnish biogas production, a potentially disruptive technology, without making any a priori assumptions about relevant regime interactions and forms of niche protection. we show that economisation affects the resources recovered and the outputs that remain mere externalities: indicating that some niche configurations are not as sustainable as others.\",\"learning processes during regime shifts: empirical evidence from the diffusion of greywater recycling in spain. the water supply paradigm in urban catalonia has experienced a significant transformation toward water decentralization since the approval in 2002 of the first ordinance on water conservation. local water ordinances make mandatory the installation of rainwater harvesting and greywater reuse systems in new buildings. by 2012, about 50 municipalities in catalonia had approved similar regulations. this paper analyzes the avenues and limits of the evolution and regionalization of the transition and focuses on the various types of learning that the adoption of greywater reuse systems has triggered in the barcelona area. during the take-off of the technology, greywater reuse systems were relatively rudimentary but later on, membrane technologies gained popularity which facilitated a more widespread use and acceptance of the technology. the cooperation of the main actors involved in this water transition has been instrumental to move the transition forward but more efforts at the regional level are still required.\",\"the need to increase the policy relevance of the functional approach to technological innovation systems (tis). highlights: the functional approach to tis can increase its policy relevance. functional approach to tis papers should better justify their normative choices. policy recommendations can be substantiated by visiting related literature. abstract in this viewpoint we propose two measures to increase the policy relevance of studies applying the functional approach to technological innovation systems (tis): (a) justify the policy relevance of the case in detail to address the normative character of the functions approach; and (b) strengthen the links to existing studies outside of the tis literature.\",\"pluralising progress: from integrative transitions to transformative diversity. this paper examines key issues raised by consideration of diversity in the study of environmental innovation and societal transitions. in different ways and degrees, these implicate many contrasting perspectives, including innovation studies, evolutionary economics and transitions research. the paper therefore attends equally to the implications of plurality among disciplines as observing subjects and varieties of sociotechnical configurations as observed objects. inspired by recent literatures in these fields, the argument focuses in turn on: contending social normativities concerning alternative directions for innovation; divergent disciplinary understandings of societal transitions; and disparate conceptualisations of sociotechnical diversity itself. in each area, the paper identifies some persistent forms of 'misplaced concreteness'. recommendations are made as to how the implications of diversity might be addressed in more rigorous and reflective ways. in conclusion, it is shown how rigour and reflexivity themselves depend on plural analytical communities paying greater regard to diversity and striking their own balance between pluralism and concreteness. this highlights a series of specific, but hitherto unresolved, research questions.\",\"complexity, tensions, and ambiguity of intermediation in a transition context: the case of connecting mobility. in this paper, we demonstrate the complexity of intermediation in practice. intermediaries are seen as crucial actors in a transition process, but so far the transition intermediary literature has had a positive bias towards their role. we mobilize strong structuration theory to develop an analytical perspective that captures how complexity, tensions, and ambiguity influence the transition intermediary's role and activities. we apply the perspective to the case of connecting mobility, a transition intermediary in the dutch smart mobility field. results show that connecting mobility has fulfilled several transition intermediary roles to different degrees, both simultaneously and sequentially, but they also experienced difficulties in fulfilling these. we conclude that the roles and the engagement of transition intermediaries in meaningful activities are a response to their dynamic context and internal learning processes. as an additional consequence, a single transition intermediary's direct impact on the overall transition process should not be overstated.\",\"entrepreneurship and the sustainable bioeconomy transformation. governments worldwide have formulated visions of a transition toward a bio-based economy (bioeconomy). these visions to move beyond the exploitation of fossil resources complement the united nation's sustainability goals such as climate change mitigation. different factors will shape and foster the successful transition to a knowledge-based bioeconomy; among those factors, entrepreneurial activity is especially promising. therefore, this study examines the enabling and transformational role of entrepreneurship by conducting a structured literature review and thematic analysis to elicit the implicit views on entrepreneurs and their ventures found in the bioeconomy literature. the review identifies three major entrepreneurial themes addressed in the literature that are included in a holistic framework comprising entrepreneurial activity on the micro level, entrepreneurial ecosystems (or clusters and innovation systems) on the meso level, and governmental vision and support on the macro level. suggestions for further research on the interface of entrepreneurship and the bioeconomy

niche innovations and assigns an important role for institutional work in this respect. previous work has conceptually and empirically substantiated a range of strategies that institutional entrepreneurs perform. however, little is known about how institutional entrepreneurs engage differently in institutional strategies across different dynamic niche contexts. we distinguish between four different niche contexts: market-based niche development, market-based regime transformation, community-based niche development and community-based regime transformation. this typology is then conceptually combined with theory on institutional entrepreneurship and institutional work to examine the diverse agential processes of institutional change through which actors shape and transform their institutional environments. the usefulness of this framework is explored in an analysis of the low-carbon building stock in the netherlands. the analysis demonstrates that the framework offers a comprehensive approach to examine variety in the arsenal of strategies of institutional work across different contexts.\",\"niche construction and empowerment through socio-political work. a meta-analysis of six low-carbon technology cases. in the sustainability transitions literature the idea of 'protective space' shielding niche innovations from unfriendly selection environments is a fundamental concept. few studies pause to consider how and by whom such protective space is created, maintained or expanded. the paper develops three propositions to deepen our understanding of the 'outward-oriented socio-political work' performed by technology advocates. the paper conducts a meta-analysis of six low-carbon technology case studies in the uk and the netherlands. in each case, analysis finds the cases relevant to the propositions, but requiring finer nuance and further development.\",\"building networks and coalitions to promote transformational change: insights from an australian urban water planning case study. innovation in governance for inducing transformative societal change is widely promoted in academic literature, yet there remains a lack of detailed prescription for successfully operationalising these new approaches. drawing on an australian urban water planning case study in sydney, australia, which resembles the prescriptions of transition management, this paper details the approach undertaken to generate transformative change in urban water management practices. this empirical case reveals key processes related to developing and sustaining multiple, actor-networks, which through coordinated activity built key social, political and technical coalitions in support of changing urban water management practices. building on insights from transition management literature, and the outcomes of this transformational case study, the paper proposes five design considerations which provide a starting point for policy-makers, or relevant actors, who are seeking to generate transformative change, irrespective of whether a policy mandate for a dedicated programme of change exists.\",\"from terminating to transforming: the role of phase-out in sustainability transitions. phase-out is rapidly gaining traction as a central part of practical efforts to address sustainability challenges. however, the way it has been conceived of in policy debates and some academic work is problematic in that it (1) tends to be narrowly focused on substitution; (2) underexposes the bi-directional relationship between phase-outs and innovation; and (3) pays insufficient attention to political challenges. to fully reap the potential of phase-out in sustainability transitions, we call for a more integrative body of scholarship. we identify three important avenues to advance this agenda: first, shifting the unit of analysis to socio-technical systems and the reconfiguration of entire regimes will help to elucidate the multiple logics underlying phase-outs. second, deepening insights on the timing and interaction between phase-out and innovation will unveil the potential of phase-outs in accelerating transitions. finally, engaging with issues of power, political legitimacy, and equity is required to mitigate political challenges.\",\"millennials and the sharing economy: lessons from a \\u2018buy nothing new, share everything month\\u2019 project. there is a growing consensus that millennials (people born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s) have embraced the sharing economy in large numbers, adopting a new mindset in which access to goods and services is seen as more valuable than ownership of them. while surveys suggest this shift may be underway, little research has been done on behavior directly. this paper is a step in that direction. my project examines student engagement with the sharing economy through experiential learning. for one month, students were asked not to buy anything new, other than food and absolute necessities. instead, they were expected to rely on the sharing economy to meet their needs and then to describe their experiences. i use mixed-methods design to analyze the resulting data quantitatively and qualitatively. although the findings do not generalize to millennials as a whole, they point to a possible research program with which to test millennial engagement with the sharing economy. the results also suggest that a shift toward this new, access-driven mindset may be more challenging than popularly assumed.\",\"evaluating integrated impacts of low-emission transitions in the livestock sector. this paper provides the results of a combined qualitative and quantitative assessment of key impacts for two low-emission transition pathways for the dutch livestock sector. these impacts or side-effects can be positive or negative. both pathways were designed to meet a sector specific methane emission reduction target of 33 % in 2030 (relative to 2005). the qualitative assessment with stakeholders resulted in developing off-model quantifications to better reflect expected changes in system dynamics and development of more realistic transition pathways used for macro-econometric (e3me) and atmospheric (tm5-fasst) modelling. we found that each low-emission transition pathway has a unique footprint of positive and negative impacts. this footprint is largely shaped by the combination of existing and new technologies, infrastructure used, and practices deployed. we consider the analysis and results relevant for climate policy and governance processes where there is a need to develop transition pathways that are optimised to meet different sustainable development goals.\",\"from institutional work to transition work: actors creating, maintaining and disrupting transition processes. this contribution outlines how transition processes can be analysed as \\u2018transition work\\u2019. we draw on the concept of institutional work, review existing applications in transition research and adapt it to transitions, labelling the result \\u2018transition work\\u2019. transition work details how actors \\u2018create\\u2019, \\u2018maintain\\u2019 and \\u2018disrupt\\u2019 transition processes. by analysing instances around the evolution of policies, organisations, networks and technologies in two cases of energy transitions in germany, we observe how actors apply transition work to accelerate and decelerate transitions. despite analysing very different cases, we find that creating, maintaining, and disrupting are all integral activities of transition processes. particularly, we observe a lack of stabilisation of a transition process where \\u2018maintain\\u2019 activities of transition proponents are scarce: maintain activities cannot only preserve the status quo, but also stabilise transition activities. for understanding disruption, likewise, we need to consider both disruptive and defensive work.\",\"a netnographic study of p2p collaborative consumption platforms\\u2019 user interface and design. although still embryonic, collaborative consumption and the sharing economy have become social and economic phenomena in just a few short years, yet there is little consensus on how to define them. the current classificatory schema or typologies of platforms have some weaknesses. sectoral classifications, technological functionality, and discursive modes of understanding sharing and collaborative economies all provide valuable insights, but when taken individually important gaps are evident, not least in their inter-system isolation, but most particularly when technology, such as platform architecture and user interfaces, is disassociated from wider social and economic conditions of possibility. in order to build on previous research we set out to develop a more complex understanding of collaborative consumption by studying platform architecture, interface, design and informational content to examine how technological affordances of digital platforms\\u2019 structure social interaction. in order to carry out the research we designed a netnographic protocol that systematised data collection across four dimensions of platforms\\u2019 technological structure and informational content: functionality and usability; trust and virtual reputation; codes of conduct and community footprint. data was collected on fifty-five platforms, including forty-seven across belgium, italy, portugal and spain, as well as eight international platforms. following factor and cluster analysis, and on the basis of the theoretical understandings of the sharing and collaborative economy, we developed a typology that grouped platforms into three groups: network, transaction and community oriented.\",\"a new institutional economics perspective on environmental issues. this paper focuses on how to deal with environmental problems, through the lenses of the new institutional economics. the emphasis is on the intertwined role of organizational solutions and their institutional settings. this is not to say that technological solutions to environmental problems should be dismissed. however, it is argued that 'environmental innovation' is often of organizational nature, deeply embedded in institutions that adapt very slowly, making 'societal transitions' particularly challenging. the new institutional economics provides some key concepts to explore these dimensions and their interactions, thus shedding light on alternative solutions and the conditions of their implementation. most examples come from the water sector.\",\"diffusion intermediaries: a taxonomy based on renewable electricity technology in sweden. the purpose of this paper is to explore the characteristics and activities of intermediaries that are involved in innovation diffusion and, thus, contribute to the acceleration of sustainability transitions. the paper develops a taxonomy of four types of diffusion intermediaries based on official firm registry data on intermediaries involved in renewable electricity technologies in sweden, which differ from each other in terms of business activity width and sectoral coverage. an analysis of the intermediaries\\u2019 business descriptions shows that: (1) most intermediaries are not exclusively involved in intermediation and many are active in several sectors, (2) the relative importance of different intermediation activities varies between different types of intermediaries, and (3) diffusion intermediation has a technology-specific component. these findings imply that researchers and policy makers should not treat diffusion intermediaries as a homogeneous collective. moreover, there might be an (unexploited) potential for intermediaries and policy makers to exploit cross-sectoral learning.\",\"framing the collaborative economy \\u2014voices of contestation. within the context of multiple crises and change, a range of practices discussed under the umbrella term of collaborative (or sharing) economy have been gaining considerable attention. supporters build an idealistic vision of collaborative societies. critics have been stripping the concept of its visionary potential, questioning its revolutionary nature. in the study, these debates are brought down to the local level in search for common perceptions among the co-creators of the concept in vienna, austria. towards this aim a q study is conducted, i.e. a mixed method enabling analyses of subjective perceptions on socially contested topics. four framings are identified: visionary supporters, market optimists, visionary critics, and sceptics, each bringing their values, visions, and practical goals characteristic of different understanding of the collaborative economy. the study questions the need for building a globally-applicable definition of the concept, calls for more context-sensitivity, exploratory studies, and city-level multi-stakeholder dialogues.\",\"urban sustainability transitions in a context of multi-level governance: a comparison of four european states. urban sustainability transitions have attracted increasing academic interest. however, the political-institutional contexts, in which these urban sustainability transitions unfold and by which they are incited, shaped, or inhibited, have received much less attention. this is why we aim at extending previous studies of sustainability transitions by incorporating a multi-level governance perspective. while multi-level governance has been a long-standing theme in political science research, it has remained under-explored in the study of sustainability transitions. this claim is the starting point of our comparative analysis of urban sustainability transitions in brighton (uk), dresden (germany), genk (belgium) and stockholm (sweden). our approach \\u201cbrings the politics back in\\u201d by elucidating the dynamics of power concentration and power dispersion generated by different national governance contexts. in our analysis, we explore which opportunities and obstacles these diverse governance contexts provide for urban sustainability transitions.\",\"creating innovative zero carbon homes in the united kingdom \\u2014 intermediaries and champions in building projects. a transition to zero carbon buildings is needed for mitigating climate change. yet, it is far from gaining sufficient momentum in many countries, particularly the united kingdom. this article focuses on actors and platforms facilitating change towards zero carbon residential buildings by integrating the concepts of innovation intermediaries and champions. drawing on interview data and building on the literatures of innovation intermediaries, champions and strategic niche management, the article analyses actor configurations in three new build housing projects. the findings show that actors and platforms acting as innovation intermediaries advance zero carbon buildings at different stages of project development, with varying intensity, influence and longevity. some intermediaries take also championing roles, while also other actors champion projects when intermediation is absent. at a time of limited policy support for zero carbon housing innovations, intermediation and championing activities become especially important in the transition towards zero carbon buildings.\",\"the digital sharing economy: a confluence of technical and social sharing. with the diffusion of digital technologies, new forms of sharing have emerged called \\u2018the sharing economy\\u2019. digitalization has been the enabler for covering a broad range of sharable resources (technical aspect of sharing) and for operating beyond the limits of small groups and personal relationships (social aspect of sharing). this two-fold digital transition of sharing has enabled unprecedented efficiency in coordinating access to resources. it created new patterns and practices of sharing in the space between traditional sharing on one side and the formal market economy on the other side; leading to the emergence of a new class of resource allocation systems which we call \\u2018the digital sharing economy (dse)\\u2019. we analyse the dse as a socio-economic phenomenon without referring to normative presuppositions, such as the presence of pro-social motivations for sharing. building on a comprehensive definition of the dse, we propose a theoretical framework for the dse that embraces and structures the broad variety of sharing platforms and the practices promoted by them. by separating our analysis from normative premises about sharing, we hope to contribute to an unbiased discussion of the sharing economy phenomenon and to lay the ground for differentiated assessments which refer to explicit normative frameworks such as sustainable development.\",\"dynamic capabilities for water system transitions in oklahoma. based on semi-structured interviews with key decision-makers from 38 distinct municipal water utilities in oklahoma, this paper examines the innovation process that drives water system transitions in response to external pressures, including climate change, policy, and economic trends; and to address internal system needs, such as supply expansion and infrastructure upgrades. a multiple linear regression analysis reveals a strong, positive relationship between innovations and dynamic capabilities, suggesting that dynamic capabilities are crucial to the transition of water systems. the strength of the relationship between sensing, seizing and reconfiguring dynamic capabilities and innovations differs by type of innovation. water manager awareness of the state-level water for 2060 act was shown to have significant influence on the number of innovations generated by municipal water systems, while water manager licensure level was not a reliable predictor of innovation. recommendations for encouraging much needed radical innovations are outlined.\",\"transitions in urban water management and patterns of international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral collaboration in urban water science. practitioners and scientists dealing with urban water management call for a transition to adaptive regimes. transition management theories claim that to induce transitions, new forms of research are necessary which cut across traditional disciplinary, organizational and sectoral boundaries. are such current calls for collaboration reflected in a fundamental change in scientific practices at the international level? this paper explores whether we witness cross-boundary interactions in professional networks and changes in the knowledge production towards more collaborative patterns in urban water science. to this end, we investigate both the professional interaction network at an international congress and the development of scientific output over the last two decades, using social network and bibliometric techniques. the results suggest that the professional interactions indeed reflect the cross-boundary interactions needed for a transition. however, the emerging patterns in scientific output do not indicate an actual system level shift towards a new mode of knowledge production.\",\"towards a multi-scalar perspective on transition trajectories. this paper contributes to the geography of transitions literature by conceptualizing transition trajectories from a multi-scalar perspective. it combines an institutional perspective of transitions with conceptions of scale from human geography to derive a framework which explicates how (de-)institutionalization and re-scaling mechanisms condition different transition trajectories. our conceptual elaborations show that the traditional local-global niche cumulation and upscaling trajectory can be complemented with two alternative trajectories that build on analytically different sequences of institutionalization and re-scaling processes. this is illustrated through a case study of technology standardization in the sanitation sector, more specifically the development of the iso 30500 standard for non-sewered sanitation systems, which was initiated by a consortium led by the bill and melinda gates foundation. the observed transition trajectory departs from key assumptions of the local-global niche model, with actors engaging in direct institutionalization at the global level, followed by re-scaling global rationalities into different (sub-)national contexts.\",\"governing the second deep transition towards a circular economy: how rules emerge, align and diffuse. the recently developed deep transitions framework has so far been mainly used to explore the first deep transition towards industrial modernity. this paper looks at a potential second deep transition towards a circular economy, which is hoped to lead to a more sustainable global economic system. our focus is on exploring the role of the eu in developing and diffusing this emerging set of rules. we draw on ideas from the international relations literature to explain why and how the eu adopted the idea of a circular economy, helped formulate it into a set of rules and how it promoted its international diffusion. the paper concludes with lessons about the case and critical reflections about the deep transitions framework. in particular, we argue for taking a more actor-based approach when researching the unfolding second deep transition.\",\"the battle of the buzzwords: a comparative review of the circular economy and the sharing economy concepts. circular economy (ce) and sharing economy (se) are much discussed concepts but potential links between them have not been examined systematically so far. the concepts\\u2019 popularity coupled with a lack of definitional consensus may hinder their potential to advance sustainability transitions. hence, the first comparative bibliometric study of these two concepts was carried out. it was found that they share notable links in the fields of sustainability, business models, sustainable consumption and governance. business model literature reveals links mostly in the realms of platform- and service-based activities. the field of se has a strong consumer focus but, unlike ce, barely addressed rebound effects so far. governance literature shows a general top-down dynamic driving ce, while se is considered to be bottom-up. se is conceptualized as a subset of ce which opens possibilities for mutual enrichment. the findings aim to provoke more dialogue between the ce and se communities.\",\"informal institutions matter: professional culture and the development of biogas technology. institutions play a crucial role for the development and diffusion of novel technologies. many studies have analyzed the role of formal institutions such as support policies or specific r&d programs, while informal institutions have received less attention. with this paper, we contribute to the institutional analysis of emerging technological fields as we examine how the effects of formal institutions depend on informal institutional structures. we present findings from a comparative study of biogas technology in selected austrian regions. our findings suggest that the professional culture in which farmers are embedded modulates the effects of feed-in tariffs and investment subsidies to a considerable extent. this explains regional differences in the diffusion as well as variations in the design and operation of biogas plants. we argue that studies on emerging technologies benefit from a systematic analysis of the interplay of regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive institutions. we also argue that socichnical variation is an important indicator to look at in addition to diffusion rates.\",\"intermediaries to accelerate the diffusion of wooden multi-storey construction in finland. intermediaries can potentially help reduce institutional lock-ins that slow down sustainability transitions by influencing policy processes, because of their connectedness and often high level of legitimacy. in this paper, we analysed intermediaries seeking to accelerate the diffusion of wooden multi-storey construction (wmc) in finland, their roles and engagement in policy processes. increasing the use of wood in construction has high policy support nationally, backed up with climate and forest policies. yet, market diffusion has been slow. the data consist of qualitative interviews of intermediaries and other actors, participatory observation and a review of secondary materials. the results reveal a complex set of intermediaries, including systemic, niche and regime-based ones. the intermediaries are characterised by multiple goals, partly over-lapping roles and means of policy influencing. the low degree of coordination among the intermediaries and the differences in their agenda for transition are critical challenges which limit the effectiveness of their actions.\",\"the politics of innovation spaces for low-carbon energy: introduction to the special issue. energy systems around the globe face multiple, major pressures to transform into more sustainable ones. over the past decades numerous, potentially sustainable energy innovations have been proposed, studied, developed and implemented to varying degrees. in the field of transition studies, scholars have used the notion of 'protective space' to study how such innovations emerge, grow, survive and decline over time, but few take an explicit political perspective on these dynamics. this editorial briefly reviews why such a perspective is necessary, and, on the basis of the contributions in this special issue, what it could entail in evolutionary, relational and institutional terms. the paper ends with six lessons for those involved in sustainable innovation advocacy.\",\"challenges in mobilising financial resources for renewable energy - the cases of biomass gasification and offshore wind power. to mitigate climate change, substantial investments are needed in emerging renewable energy technologies. however, developers of the technologies - both capital goods suppliers and utilities - lack the capital to make the required investments, and other investors hesitate because of the high risks and low returns involved. this article analyses the challenges of financing the development and large-scale diffusion of biomass gasification and offshore wind power in europe. biomass gasification needs to take the step from public to private finance and find investors willing to make a sizable investment with high risk. mobilising the amount of capital needed to bring about large-scale diffusion of offshore wind power will require innovative financial solutions. to overcome these challenges, changes are needed in both the financial sector and in firms in the energy sector. amongst other suggestions this article points to bonds specially designed for renewable energy as one way to increase investment.\",\"how power and politics shape niche-regime interactions: a view from the global south. the significant role of politics in shaping sustainability transitions (st) is well-recognized but still under-researched, especially in the global south, where institutional context can differ widely from the global north. for instance, informal transport is a unique and common feature of many global south countries and constitutes complexity that is not captured adequately by transition studies\\u2019 conceptual frameworks. this study explores how power and politics surrounding informal occupations shape niche-regime interactions in a global south country by examining the emergence, development and subsequent legitimization of the informal electric rickshaw (er) transport in delhi (india). the study shows the limitation of dichotomous conceptualizations like niche/new entrants vs. regime/incumbents and fit-and-conform vs. stretch-and-transform in understanding niche-regime interactions and argues that studying how politics of transition unfolds in the global south's informal spaces can broaden the conceptual horizons.\",\"understanding the development of flood management in the middle yangtze river. this study aims to investigate whether, to what extent and how a transition toward integrated flood management has taken place in the dongting lake area at the middle yangtze. accordingly, we conducted a longitudinal research of its flood management (1949-2009). we developed an analytical framework linking regime components to two societal learning types (double and triple-loop learning) that are key to a regime transition. our study shows that the transition toward integrated flood management has already started, but the whole regime transformation will still take time to complete, due to, for example, the not-yet-ready decision-making processes that shape the structure changes as well as the incompatibilities between what is on paper and real implementation. to understand how the regime transition took place, we investigated where and how triple-loop learning was initiated as well as how so-called \\\"informal learning processes\\\" has contributed to the transition of dongting flood management.\",\"anticipated emotions and resistance to innovations: the case of p2p car sharing. peer-to-peer (p2p) car sharing is a sociotechnical innovation that could facilitate a transition to a more sustainable mobility system. understanding the factors hampering adoption of this innovation is of outmost importance. whereas past studies have expounded on the advantages and disadvantages that potential adopters see in these schemes, this study takes a different route and studies individuals\\u2019 anticipated emotions toward the innovation at the intrapersonal and interpersonal level. this approach unveils that potential adopters anticipate the burden of sharing or feelings of stress, anxiety and fear if they enter the schemes. the anticipated burden of sharing deters potential adopters from adopting this innovation. these insights provide a complementary explanation to understand the factors inhibiting the adoption of sociotechnical innovations.\",\"towards transformative leapfrogging. latecomer countries are increasingly confronted with the simultaneous challenge of achieving industry competitiveness and sustainability transitions. we revisit the long-standing debate on how latecomers may break free from the trajectories of the developed countries and leapfrog into more sustainable directions. connecting insights from the fields of catching-up, socio-technical transitions, and economic geography, we propose a heuristic typology of four development pathways for latecomers. while the catching-up literature has focused on knowledge development as a main strategy, we posit that to address grand challenges, it is imperative for latecomers to implement valuation-focused strategies, which include shaping technology legitimacy, markets, and finance flows at the systemic level. we showcase the shifting trajectory of the chinese solar photovoltaic industry from technology catching-up to forging ahead in pre-existing global value chains, and eventually towards transformative leapfrogging aimed at reconfiguring the entire socio-technical system of the electricity sector. we conclude with a research agenda for latecomer development.\",\"finding convergence: economic perspectives and the economic practices of an australian ecovillage. the practices of ecologically-minded alternative communities illuminate differing perspectives on what might constitute an economy. this paper explores the extant literature and presents a framework for considering four spheres of confluence between the modern market economy and diverse economies: economic production practices, attitudes towards growth, environmental responsiveness and the socialrelational context of transactions. drawing on evidence from an australian ecovillage, the paper adopts the framework presented as a means of understanding the experiences of cooperatively negotiating various practices necessary to establish an intentionally sustainable community economy. through this analysis, the paper provides insights into ways ecovillages may operate in the context of the modern market economy without adopting all of its practices. ecovillages may indeed be places where convergence between economic approaches may be incubated, experienced and experimented, and through closer trading with the local external communities opportunities for the diffusion of such practices may ensue.\",\"wider learning outcomes of european climate change adaptation projects: a qualitative comparative analysis. learning in project settings may contribute to a societal transition when learning outcomes become situated in organizations or networks that are external to the project. this paper examines to what extent and under which conditions european cooperation projects contribute to such wider learning outcomes. learning outcomes are assessed using five progressing stages of knowledge utilization. we use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to determine how seven potentially relevant conditions influence learning outcomes. from the systematic comparison of 30 cases (i.e. organizations who participated in seven selected projects) we conclude that, on the short-term, there is no relation between high levels of project-internal learning and wider learning outcomes. for wider learning outcomes to occur, a project needs to be aligned with formal policy processes. when \\u201cpolicy agenda alignment\\u201d is present, \\u201cmotivation\\u201d, \\u201cexternal actor involvement\\u201d and \\u201cproject knowledge and communication\\u201d are sufficient for the use of project knowledge by external actors.\",\"transaction costs and the transition to environmentally sustainable development. as global environmental problems mount, the transition to sustainable economic development seems elusive. a major reason is that the world is facing a monumental challenge in overcoming policy, market and institutional failures. the most formidable barriers are institutional rigidities and transaction costs that replicate the same patterns of resource-based development, despite the rising costs associated with increasing environmental degradation. vested interests reinforce this institutional intransigence. reorienting economies to foster more sustainable development will only succeed if we overcome these institutional barriers and costs.\",\"theorising the dynamics of collaborative consumption practices: a comparison of peer-to-peer accommodation and cohousing. this article aims to make a contribution to a more nuanced, theory-based interpretation of current dynamics of collaborative consumption (cc). first, i develop my own definition of cc practices, highlighting the engagement of at least two individuals who get involved in direct interaction and make use of the same units of goods and services. this conceptualisation leads me to a compilation of some exemplary cc practices. empirical data shows a very uneven diffusion of these practices in france and in germany. social practice theory (spt) is suggested as very fruitful theoretical framework to explain these diverging dynamics. to illustrate the usefulness of this approach, i then compare two specific cc forms, p2p accommodation and cohousing. my analysis shows that p2p accommodation has formed a highly attractive practice configuration with very good chances to \\u2018recruit hosts\\u2019, while cohousing presents a rather demanding \\u2018practice-as-entity\\u2019 with rather restricted opportunities to find practitioners. to conclude, i suggest to complement spt with insights from the multi-level-perspective in order to better account for \\u2018systemic\\u2019, vertical processes, which affect the \\u2018availability\\u2019 of practice elements.\",\"a practice approach to study the spatial dimensions of the energy transition. the spatial dimension of the energy transition has received increasing interest over the last years. this paper discusses the potentials of a practice approach to better understand the role of space, place and scale in transition processes and applies it to a case study in beckerich, luxembourg. the practice approach focuses transition practices as main conceptual and empirical object. it enables us to explore processes, contexts, and spaces of the energy transition. an in-depth case study illustrates transition practices and their implications for the 'renewable energy arena'. the findings highlight the importance of analysing developments on the ground and how local actors (re)produce contexts. they illustrate how a practice-sensitive analysis helps to better understand the processes of niche formation and the spatial dimension of underlying mechanisms of transitions.\",\"a comparison of the neo-schumpeterian theory of kondratiev waves and the multi-level perspective on transitions. this paper explores the relationship of the neo-schumpeterian theory for kondratiev waves, also called 'long waves' of economic growth, to transition theory, in particular the multi-level perspective. the two conceptual frameworks have a similar description of the development of new technologies. while they both use the ontology of co-evolution, the mlp combines this with science and technology studies, giddens' structuration theory and neoinstitutionalism. neo-schumpeterian theory can contribute to the consideration of landscape dynamics in the mlp, while agency in the niche-regime interactions emphasised by the mlp could be used to extend the analysis of kondratiev waves.\",\"nobody was dirty: cultural exhibitions as societal transition tools. this brief article shares a social transition attempt where a cultural exhibition was used to question the resources consumed in the name of cleanliness. thirty-two pairs of unwashed jeans were installed at the national gallery of victoria with the aim of making people more aware of the hyper-clean social standards reproduced in everyday life, that consume energy, water and chemicals. this short speculative piece aims to contribute to the environmental innovation and societal transitions dialogue by conceptualising cultural interventions, like exhibitions, as a societal transition tool, and providing empirical data on one cultural exhibition's attempt to shift cleanliness practices away from resource intensity.\",\"navigators through the storm: a review of organization theories and the behavior of incumbent firms during transitions. the literature on socio-technical transitions pays increasing attention to the role of incumbent firms during transitions. these firms have been found to variably further, delay, or to ignore transitions towards a more sustainable society. yet, it remains unclear which factors cause incumbents to display different modes of behavior during transitions, and which factors affect the transition's impact on an incumbent's survival. we engage this issue by reviewing five prominent organization theories. we first discuss how the transitions literature conceptualizes incumbent behavior and relate the open questions to major debates in the organizational literature. we systematically summarize each organization theory's assumptions and expectations about incumbent behavior, and derive typical modes of behavior. lastly, we discuss how an incumbent's characteristics influence its behavior and survival. overall, our review provides stable footing for researchers seeking to conscientiously judge which theories are most appropriate to understand incumbent behavior in the transition process at hand.\",\"virtual user communities contributing to upscaling innovations in transitions: the case of electric vehicles. users are increasingly acknowledged as important actors fostering those fundamental socio-technical innovations needed to achieve a sustainable society. in the literature, users have so far been portrayed mostly to play a role in early phases of technology formation. however, more recently users have become important players in the upscaling of various innovations. with the advent of new social media, users may interact effortlessly across large distances, exchange knowledge and so increase their contribution to upscaling. we investigate the new potential of virtual user communities. conceptually, we build on recent insights from socio-technical transition studies to identify different upscaling dimensions. we conduct an internet ethnography of a large virtual community that formed around the electric vehicle (ev). based on these data, we present virtual community characteristics and core mechanisms of participation in upscaling. we find that the community plays an important and distinctive role in fostering electric vehicle use.\",\"conceptualising institutional complexity in the upscaling of community enterprises: lessons from renewable energy and carsharing. community enterprises may play pivotal roles in sustainability transitions but have received limited attention in the transitions literature. this paper proposes a framework for theorising the challenges that community enterprises face as they scale up due to the rising institutional complexity of their organisational model, combining the institutional logics of community, market, and corporation. we conceptualise the upscaling processes of community enterprises by distinguishing between the community volunteerism phase, the niche creation phase and the niche expansion phase. we formulate nine propositions on how institutional complexity arises and on possible mechanisms to manage it in each phase of the upscaling process. our theoretical framework is supported by empirical research on carsharing and renewable energy initiatives in western europe. the paper concludes with some avenues for further research on community enterprises in sustainability transitions.\",\"analysis of institutional work on innovation trajectories in water infrastructure systems of melbourne, australia. infrastructure systems are facing sustainability challenges but are locked into their current practices. transitions studies aims to understand trajectories towards new socio-technical regimes and argue for agency-centric perspectives to explain processes of change. this paper adopts an institutional lens, examining the institutional creation processes needed for maturing innovations within established systems. three innovations in melbourne's water system were selected as empirical cases: desalination, wastewater recycling and stormwater harvesting. each had a different institutional alignment with the established regime and different trajectories between key stages of maturity, from pre-niche to niche, niche-regime and regime. the paper examines the purposes and types of institutional work undertaken to support each stage: cultural-cognitive, normative and regulative. their trajectories were influenced by the regime alignment and characterised by maturation speed, institutional work undertaken and limiting conditions for further maturation. cross-case comparison enabled derivation of hypotheses on the linkage between institutional work and innovation maturity\",\"participatory modeling for transition governance: linking methods to process phases. participatory modeling \\u2013 the involvement of stakeholders in the modeling process \\u2013 can support various objectives, such as stimulating learning processes or promoting mutual understanding of stakeholders. participatory modeling approaches could therefore be useful for the governance of transitions, but a systematic account of potential application areas of participatory modeling methods in transition governance is still lacking. this article addresses this gap by providing a review of participatory modeling methods and linking them to phases and objectives of transition governance. we reviewed participatory modeling studies in transition research and related fields of social-ecological modeling, integrated assessment and environmental management. we find that participatory modeling methods are mostly used for participatory visioning and goal setting as well as for interactive strategy development. the review shows the potential for extending the application of participatory modeling methods to additional phases of transition governance and for the exchange of experiences between research fields.\",\"an interdisciplinary perspective on scaling in transitions: connecting actors and space. the question of how sustainable innovations and how niche experimentation lead to systemic changes are a core motivation of sustainability transitions research. as an inherently interdisciplinary field, although this question is addressed from different academic perspectives, the dominant understanding of relevant scaling processes is grounded in concepts of growth, diffusion and expansion. this article contributes to the discussion of more nuanced understandings of scaling, acknowledging the value of ontological levels for analytic purposes, but also drawing on knowledge from socio-psychological and spatial perspectives. alternative understandings of spatial and agency-related scaling approaches are discussed and compared. an integrative socio-spatial framework is developed, providing a mid-range framework capable of supporting analysis of transitions that connects different disciplinary perspectives within a level-based ontology. we use an illustrative case study and derive implications for how this can inform questions of scaling and particularly spatial upscaling of new ways of doing, thinking & organizing\",\"toward a spatial perspective on niche development: the case of bus rapid transit. this paper responds to recent criticism from geographers that the 'local-global' niche model in transition studies is spatially na\\u00efve. a number of relevant geography literatures (buzz-pipelines, global production networks, policy mobilities) are mobilized to develop a more geographically nuanced understanding of niche development. the result complements the original model by providing center stage to (1) the spatialities of the production and transfer of knowledge, (2) the geographies of the actor networks involved and (3) the dynamics of embeddedness by which these global networks and knowledge discourses become entangled with place-specific power relationships, institutions and infrastructures. to illustrate this empirically, we trace the tortuous innovation journey of bus rapid transit - a promising new mode of urban transportation that is spreading rapidly across the globe.\",\"sharing among neighbours in a norwegian suburb. sharing goods and services has been promoted as fostering more sustainable consumption. in this paper, we explore sharing in a middle-class neighbourhood in a norwegian city. we ask what influences and frames neighbours\\u2019 current sharing practices, contending that polanyi's notions of exchange systems, specifically reciprocity and redistribution, yield valuable insights for our study. we show that reciprocal and redistributive sharing may reinforce each other by increasing the frequency of sharing and the variety of items shared. furthermore, redistributive sharing systems may foster close relations and interpersonal trust, which are prerequisites for reciprocal sharing. hence, if the goal is to increase the rate of sharing of goods and services in neighbourhoods like that studied here, two initiatives can be valid. first, items with the right affordances can be redistributed by existing institutions; second, reciprocity can be encouraged by organising more opportunities for resident interaction.\",\"coping with uncertainties of sustainability transitions using exploratory modelling: the case of the matisse model and the uk's mobility sector. modelling is an important approach for analysing the behaviour of sustainability transitions. however, the presence of uncertainty challenges the usefulness of models and our inference from model results. we use the example of the matisse agent-based model to examine conditions for a transition to a public transport mobility regime under uncertainty in the uk. we use \\u2018exploratory modelling\\u00f6 to investigate the regions of model uncertainty in a structured way. model results are generated from a wider range of input values compared to that applied normally in transitions modelling. a stochastic description of the pathways of adoption of different mobility lifestyles is developed. our approach identifies possible transition pathways under an uncertain future in response to ranges of behavioural changes of households. a sensitivity analysis over the critical behavioural parameters also shows how the interactions between households and mobility lifestyle niches are determined by the dynamics of household behaviours.\",\"a social learning and transition perspective on a climate change project in south africa. the agricultural sector of the western cape is highly affected by climate change and thus requires fundamental change to move to a more resilient path. we analyze the development of a climate change plan to obtain a better understanding of what is needed to make such a strategic intervention meaningful in terms facilitating a sustainability transition. we use the concept of transition arena to understand how group composition and processes facilitated or hindered structural change, and apply social learning theory to uncover learning processes and outcomes for whether capacity and momentum for moving towards a more climate resilient sector were created. commitment on the part of project members created trust in the project and vice versa, while the ongoing involvement of governmental actors was key for creating capacities and commitment for change. the limited participation of niche actors may have hampered the ability to identify more innovative development pathways.\",\"corporate-ngo partnership for environmentally sustainable innovation: lessons from a cross-sector collaboration in aviation biofuels. this paper studies the initiation of a partnership between a corporation and a nongovernmental organization (ngo) for environmentally sustainable innovation, as well as its development over time. proceeding from a dynamic capabilities approach, it provides a retrospective, longitudinal examination of a 10-year partnership between klm royal dutch airlines (klm) and the world wildlife fund for nature netherlands (wnf), which promoted a market for aviation biofuels. the case study suggests that the progress of the partnership is determined by three specific dynamic capabilities of klm and wnf: learning, coordination, and reconfiguration. the results reveal two microfoundations for each of these dynamic capabilities. for learning, these microfoundations are the sensing of strategic partners and the co-specialization of resources. for coordination, these consist of finding a fit between partners and having an integrated mission. finally, the microfoundations of reconfiguration are the fostering of an institutional dialogue and the setting of new industry standards. this study is beneficial to scholars as it opens a research avenue concerning the dynamic capabilities and microfoundations that support corporate-ngo partnering for environmentally sustainable innovation. practitioners can use these dynamic capabilities and microfoundations as guidelines for developing their own specific corporate-ngo partnerships.\",\"policies to minimise environmental and rebound effects from telework: a study for australia. a comparative lifecycle assessment (clca) was undertaken to determine the environmental effect or impact of teleworking compared to office-based work in a corporate setting in australia. teleworking was demonstrated to have smaller environmental effects than office-based working, but only under certain conditions. teleworking was more beneficial if an employee travels \\u226530 km each workday. the more energy efficient the employer's buildings are, the lower the environmental value of teleworking. greater energy efficiency in home offices means greater environmental benefits. if the energy used in the remote (residential) work area increases above 1212 kw h of energy per year, the environmental effects become greater than those from non-teleworking. the greater the use of renewable energy in remote compared with commercial offices, the greater the environmental benefits of teleworking. rational corporate policy recommendations were developed based on these outcomes.\",\"a constructivist approach to the spatial organization of transformative innovation policy. recent attempts to conceptualize the multi-level governance of transformative innovation policy make strong arguments in favour of pursuing societal challenges at the subnational scale. this article suggests, that these recent efforts risk falling into a scalar trap, because they rely on a theoretical assumption about the policy effectiveness of the subnational scale. in response, the paper proposes a constructivist approach to the spatial organization of transformative innovation policy. the constructivist approach views scale as continuously produced and contested by actors. moreover, it suggests that rescaling may be an important aspect of multi-level governance of transformative innovation policy because it has the potential to alter the influence of actors in the prevailing socio-technical system. the approach is illustrated with an empirical analysis of waste management in denmark where a transformative innovation policy has recently been introduced, rescaling decision-making away from a traditionally strong subnational scalar arrangement.\",\"the impact of privatization on sustainability transitions: a comparative analysis of dynamic capabilities in three water utilities. this paper analyzes the ability of water utilities to contribute to sustainability transition processes. more specifically, we compare the capacity of utilities, embedded in purely public, mixed and largely private governance modes, to innovate. we employ dynamic capabilities as core indicators for innovativeness and therefore as major enabling factors for sustainable sector transitions. we assess the relationship between governance modes and innovation by conducting an in-depth comparative analysis of three water utilities, each within a differing governance mode along the public-to-private continuum: zurich, berlin and leeds. while we find that the private and mixed governance modes have an increased degree of innovativeness, they perform lower in terms of static sustainability criteria than the public mode. we therefore conclude that the impact of privatization on sustainability transitions in the water sector involves multi-dimensional trade-offs between static and dynamic sustainability criteria.\",\"towards sustainable urban basic services in low-income countries: a technological innovation system analysis of sanitation value chains in nairobi. the provision of basic services suffers from a multitude of sustainability challenges in many cities of low-income countries. sanitation provision faces particular challenges in the form of environmental contamination, high costs, and large inequalities among urban residents. in recent years an increasing number of innovations in on-site systems have been developed, which have not yet evolved into fully functional alternatives to the existing regimes. we study three prominent recent on-site sanitation initiatives in informal settlements in nairobi, kenya that aimed at developing entire \\u201csanitation value chains\\u201d, which we conceptualize as an emerging technological innovation system (tis). the analysis leads us to propose alternative governance modes for the tis to overcome system failures such as capability, coordination and institutional barriers. conceptually, the paper extends conventional tis analyses towards entire value chains, enabling a wide range of transition processes to be addressed beyond informal settlements and low-income countries.\",\"sustainability for wellbeing. i consider the record of failure of the current arrangements of capitalism to deliver sustainability: the failure to anticipate tipping points; the over-optimism of business to deliver sustainability; the immorality of markets; and the increasing loss of public trust in democracy. i consider how to resurrect the meaning and definition of sustainability for the emerging age of human wellbeing and betterment. it is possible that the manner in which our governing institutions function actually contributes to the acceleration and intensity of critical thresholds. i discuss the relationship between international, national and local levels of governing to bring about a transition in the coming decade. i review the conditions to promote citizenship opportunities for otherwise unemployed young people and consider the prospects for the success of such initiatives at the local level. these are not perfectly connected solutions: but they are relevant ingredients for any transition to sustainability.\",\"research frontiers for multi-system dynamics and deep transitions. the sustainability transitions field has been dominated by studies on single systems. expanding the scope to deep transitions involving interactions between a broad array of socio-technical systems opens up new research directions in three important domains: 1) areas of intervention; 2) transition justice; 3) accelerating actors.\",\"green tides in brittany: what can we learn about niche-regime interactions?. the coasts of brittany (france) have witnessed algae blooms leading to 'green tides' since the 1970s. these are a typical example of a persistent environmental problem linked to intensive agriculture. we focus on how a mature niche, which proposes an extensive farming system, has extended its network, linked with the regime and drawn in resources. within the multi-level perspective, this case study is used to better understand the dynamics of niche-regime interactions. using an ant-based approach, we show how the network around the niche has evolved over the decades, how it adapted its core message, built alliances with diverse actors at niche and regime level, and recognized opportunities created by landscape pressures. this active work of building bridges through reinterpretation, of enrolling regime actors, of seizing windows of opportunity, highlights the 'social' aspect of social-technical transitions.\",\"social networks and communication behaviour underlying smart home adoption in the uk. consumer-facing digital innovations with the potential to reduce carbon emissions often exist in small market niches and their impact has been limited thus far. using the established diffusion of innovations theory which considers interpersonal communication amongst social networks to be a vital mechanism for exchanging information, we conducted an online survey in the uk to investigate the social networks and communication behaviours of adopters and non-adopters of three different energy saving smart home technologies. applying social network analysis and statistically testing hypotheses, our results reveal the potential social barriers to the diffusion of information, with social network structure and characteristics creating obstacles. this research provides necessary insights into real early adopters, confirms the importance of focussing research on the often-neglected social elements of diffusion theory and helps identify marketing strategies and policy actions using social mechanisms to accelerate a low carbon transition.\",\"the dual challenge of sustainability transitions. in this essay we argue that sustainability transitions include two challenges: on the one hand a long-term change to various technologies and infrastructures, while on the other hand ensuring that consumer criteria change in the same move. transitions that fail to do so will disappoint in the end. we review two sustainability-oriented transitions where criteria have changed: the hygienic transition around 1900 and the waste management transitions at the end of the 20th century. while in these cases the values, perceptions and criteria of people changed as part of the transition, this does not seem to apply to sustainable mobility and energy, where the main target is decarbonisation. what is missing is a reconsideration of individual mobility and conspicuous energy use.\",\"sequence and alignment of external pressures in industry destabilisation: understanding the downfall of incumbent utilities in the german energy transition (1998\\u20132015). this article makes two contributions to the emerging research stream on regime and industry destabilisation in the transition literature. first, we replicate the multi-dimensional framework developed by turnheim and geels with a more contemporary study that has closer links to sustainability transitions. drawing on a wide range of primary and secondary sources, we analyse the destabilisation of the german electricity industry, which faced multiple external pressures: renewable energy technologies, nuclear phase-out policy, the financial-economic crisis, and negative public debates. second, we elaborate the role of multiple pressures in industry destabilisation, focusing in particular on their sequence and alignment. we inductively identify patterns such as the \\u2018masking effect\\u2019 of highly visible macro-shocks, \\u2018perfect storm\\u2019 pattern, a \\u2018killer blow\\u2019 effect, and spillover dynamics between external environments.\",\"how global regimes diffuse in space \\u2013 explaining a missed transition in san diego's water sector. socio-technical regimes are highly institutionalized rationalities that have co-evolved with actors, technologies and institutions over extended periods of time and become taken for granted across geographical contexts. transition studies feature an extensive focus on regime dynamics within specific territorial contexts. however, we know surprisingly little of how regime rationalities are constructed, diffused and reproduced across space. this is a key gap in the geography of sustainability transitions literature. this paper introduces a conceptual model to analyze transformative opportunities in regions and how regime actors strategically diffuse and implement global regime solutions through combinations of discursive and substantive system reconfiguration activities. the empirical analysis draws upon a combination of socio-technical configuration analysis (stca) of 354 newspaper articles and 10 in-depth expert interviews to illuminate how regime actors prevailed in diffusing and legitimizing the water sector's dominant socio-technical configuration in san diego during a period of substantial transformative opportunities.\",\"user-led innovation in civic energy communities. building on user and grassroots innovation literature, we explore user innovations in five dutch civic energy communities. less attention has been paid to the interplay of social, symbolic and technological innovations that seems to be at the heart of many civic energy communities. in this paper, we shed light on this interplay, and explore the activities of civic energy communities as configurational user innovations, i.e. creating user-designed arrangements of loosely related sets of components. our analysis shows that configurational work combines off-the-shelf technologies with novel technical and non-technical ideas, such as business models for local energy provision, rather than endeavor clear-cut changes to existing devices. such configurational work is deeply entangled with learning processes at the community level, whereby an evolving technical identity as well as various community building activities provide a growing network of resources as necessary context for implementation of user innovations.\",\"towards an 'alternative' geography of innovation: alternative milieu, socio-cognitive protection and sustainability experimentation. this paper highlights the hitherto unrecognised role of 'alternative' places in protecting different forms of sustainability innovation. the paper uses the concept of an alternative milieu to illustrate how a geographically localised concentration of countercultural practices, institutions and networks can create socio-cognitive 'niche' protection for sustainability experiments. an alternative milieu creates protection for the emergence of novelties by (i) creating ontological and epistemological multiplicity; (ii) sustaining productive spatial imaginaries; and (iii) supporting ontological security. these different dimensions of protection are explored with reference to an in-depth, empirical case study of totnes in the united kingdom. the paper concludes with some reflections on the theoretical implications of this research for the theorising of niche protection and for the geographies of innovation more generally, along with some recommendations for future areas of enquiry.\",\"geographies of transition\\u2014from topical concerns to theoretical engagement: a commentary on the transitions research agenda. this viewpoint takes stock with the \\u2018geography of sustainability transitions\\u2019 (gost) as it is presented in the transitions research agenda. gost has been a relatively recent addition to transition theorizing, addressing the need for greater sensitivity and attention to the scales, spatialities, and context-specific factors that shape transitions. in our view, the agenda represents a rather narrow perspective on gost, which is geared to two empirical themes, namely urban transitions and transitions in developing countries. while these are relevant and topical issues, the section lacks sufficient acknowledgement of the increasing engagement of geographers with transitions studies and the theoretical approaches they have brought to bear on the field. this short commentary thus aims at complementing the agenda paper by outlining a theoretical research agenda that is emerging in this field, framed around the conceptualization of scales, places and spaces in which transitions unfold.\",\"the need for policy coherence to trigger a transition to biogas production. transitions towards more sustainable societies involve policy changes cutting across multiple sectors. ideally, policies targeting different sectors create a coherent push for the adoption of more sustainable solutions. sustainability transition studies have, however, paid little attention to the role of policy interaction across different policy domains. by focusing on biogas production in finland and by further developing the technological innovation systems functions in connection to policy coherence, this paper examines how policy coherence is related to triggering transition from the perspective of biogas actors. the results demonstrate how supportive policies in one sector are made inefficient by unsupportive policies, instruments and practices in others. however, the lack of policy coherence, especially at the local level, may also have innovation-triggering influence when it forces actors to consider unconventional solutions. thus the innovation effects of policy coherence are difficult to foresee and require an actor-focused perspective for analysis.\",\"path dependence and path break-out in the electricity sector. path dependence is a key mechanism that holds socio-technical systems in their current development trajectories. in sustainability transitions research a broad conception of path dependence prevails, which covers a variety of historical barriers to transformation. we advocate for a more narrow conception of path dependence that focuses on the underlying self-reinforcing mechanisms. we introduce theoretical work from organisation studies into transition research to conceptualise path dependence at the level of socio-technical systems and organisations, and furthermore elaborate on the phenomenon of path break-out. based on a literature review of european electricity transitions, we analyse how self-reinforcing mechanisms are weakening leading to path break-out. we identify two modes of path break-out. first, path dissolution is a result of exogenous shocks and unintentional weakening of self-reinforcing mechanisms. second, path breaking is a result of an intentional attempt to change the exiting patterns, which weakens the self-reinforcing mechanisms.\",\"incumbency and political compromises: opportunity or threat to sustainability transitions?. studying the role of incumbents is central to understanding transformation dynamics. existing studies have largely focused on incumbent firms, their corporate, technological, and political strategies within a given sector. whilst insightful, viewing incumbency as a more open concept could allow research to better examine the blurred boundaries across sectors and between sectors and the polity. the plurality of relationship could also result in more tensions and legitimacy problems for incumbents. we ask how can incumbency maintain legitimacy under such pluralistic context? we conceptualise ways contradiction may be managed through political responses and tested our hypothesis in a case study of an urban water initiative in indonesia. crisis events, governance messiness, social conflicts, and cognitive contestations are identified as important and interrelated contradictions, which have deep roots in the broader polity. incumbents also appear skilled at placating tension using piecemeal compromises to survive multiple legitimacy problems, thereby undercutting overall transformative potential.\",\"the energy futures lab: a case study of justice in energy transitions. while the concept of \\u2018just transitions\\u2019 has become more and more prominent in academic and popular discussions of sustainability transition, these conceptions are often framed in purely economic terms, and focus on the economic impact on communities, regions, and nation-states. we argue that a broader conception of justice in transitions, and in particular energy transitions, is required. questions such as who will win and who will lose as society transitions to more sustainable future, who decides what the transition will look like, how are those historically excluded from decision making recognized, and how are the interests of non-humans and future generations included are important to answer in order to ensure that concepts of justice are included in transitions processes. answering these questions is critical in \\u201censuring that system transitions are not only more sustainable, but also more just\\u201d (williams and doyon, 2019, p. 144). in this paper, we apply the justice and system transition framework (williams and doyon, 2019) to the energy futures lab (efl). we find that while the efl has made great strides towards justice in transition, the efl is also a demonstration of the challenges of incorporating justice such as addressing issues of power dynamics and conceptions of diversity and inclusion. we also find that the justice and system transitions framework proves to be a valuable tool in assessing justice in transitions projects. going beyond the common \\u2018just transition\\u2019 approach that focuses on distributive justice gives a richer conception of justice and ensures that procedural and recognition approaches are included.\",\"opening up the black box of learning-by-doing in sustainability transitions. in the face of persistent socio-ecological problems that prove hard to tackle with existing routines, the transition towards a more sustainable world is often described as a matter of \\u2018learning by doing\\u2019. despite omnipresent appeals to \\u2018learning\\u2019 in sustainability transition studies, an exploratory review of literature shows that there is a lack of conceptual clarity on the topic. furthermore, empirical research on learning in transition initiatives is rare. this article presents an analytical framework that facilitates theoretical and empirical research on learning in sustainability transitions. pragmatist educational scholarship, in particular dewey's transactional perspective, provides useful inspiration for analytical tools that allow to open-up the black box of learning in sustainability transitions. focusing on the intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional and material factors that influence learning and on how the mechanism of \\u2018privileging\\u2019 steers learning outcomes, this framework allows to investigate whether and, if so, how learning actually takes place in transition initiatives.\",\"the emergence of a global innovation system \\u2013 a case study from the urban water sector. innovation studies is increasingly acknowledging the multi-scalar nature of the systemic contexts, in which innovations are being developed and deployed. this paper builds on and further develops a recently proposed framework for studying global innovation systems (gis). it aims at explaining the emergence of a gis by outlining the specific local resource-related conditions that lead to the creation of structural couplings, i.e. actors, networks and institutions that allow for multi-scalar resource flows. deploying a qualitative case study, the paper investigates the interrelated developments of eight demonstration sites of innovative wastewater treatment technology in north-western europe. it shows how resource-related deficits lead actors to draw on resources generated outside of their local context. the paper contributes to the literature on the geography of transitions by highlighting the importance of resource complementarities among different local contexts, as well as the crucial role of trans-local systemic intermediaries in shaping an emergent gis.\",\"prospects of modelling societal transitions: position paper of an emerging community. societal transitions involve multiple actors, changes in institutions, values and technologies, and interactions across multiple sectors and scales. given this complexity, this paper takes on the view that the societal transitions research field would benefit from the further maturation and broader uptake of modelling approaches. this paper shows how modelling can enhance the understanding of and support stakeholders to steer societal transitions. it discusses the benefits modelling provides for studying large societal systems and elaborates on different ways models can be used for transitions studies. two model applications are presented in some detail to illustrate the benefits. then, limitations of modelling societal transitions are discussed, which leads to an agenda for future activities: (1) better cooperation in the development of dynamic models, (2) stronger interaction with other transition scholars and stakeholders, and (3) use of additional modelling approaches that we think are relevant to and largely unexplored in transitions studies.\",\"diversifying deep transitions: accounting for socio-economic directionality. the paper sets out to enrich the emerging debate on \\u2018deep\\u2019, transversal transitions. it does so by drawing attention to socio-economic developments neglected in the deep transition (dt) framework of kanger and schot, such as marketization, labour contracts becoming more individual and precarious, and changing human beliefs, aspirations, needs and wants as important developments. the framework of deep transition is criticised for neglecting tensions and contestations about progress, the socio-economic order and distributional issues. this paper aims to complement \\u2018deep transitions\\u2019 research with insights about socio-economic transformation processes. these are shown to be conflict-ridden and full of tensions, creating pressures on socio-economic orders and institutional logics. because of this, development does not follow a neat pattern of convergence. in addition to identifying neglected issues and conceptual blind spots, the paper also outlines the scope for conceptual bridging between socio-technical and socio-economic transformation perspectives through attention to institutional logics and dialectics of change. we make a plea for a broader dt research agenda that covers relevant socio-economic rules, meta-regimes and institutional contradictions. attention to directionality helps to deal with three weaknesses of the dt framework: the assumption of convergence, materialism, and insufficient attention to the multitude of value orientations and logics.\",\"no legitimacy: a study of private sector sanitation development in the global south. what is needed for the private sector to successfully establish itself as a key player in delivering sustainable sanitation in the global south? the present paper aims to offer some answers to this through the case of peepoople ab, a company delivering a single-use biodegradable toilet bag in informal settlements. the company aimed to but failed in combining sustainable development of sanitation and financial gain for investors. we suggest that explanations for the failure can be found in the interaction between the company and the development\\u2013 and aid organisations already involved in sanitation development. through strategic niche management, we look at whether the company managed to create relevant social networks, expectation dynamics and learning processes. the company gained legitimacy with end users, but failed to gain legitimacy in the development sector as it did not prioritise the kind of learning and competence considered relevant in the sector.\",\"disrupting transitions: qualitatively modelling the impact of covid-19 on uk food and mobility provision. the 2020 covid-19 pandemic provides an empirical testing ground for assessing the impact of critical events on societal transitions. such events are typically seen as exogenous to the transition process, an assumption which is investigated in this paper. using a qualitative system dynamics modelling approach we conceptualize transition pathways as sets of interacting sequences of events. this enables the analysis of event sequences that constitute the evolving pandemic as impacting on those pathways. we apply this approach to the provision of (auto)mobility and food in the uk. this shows the way in which the pandemic has had a differential effect on ongoing transitions in both systems, sometimes slowing them down, and sometimes accelerating them. in addition, it reveals how it has established new transition pathways. the empirical work further shows how qualitative modelling with system dynamics facilitates an explicit and systematic comparative analysis of transition case studies.\",\"dynamic capabilities and strategic reorientation towards decarbonisation in baltic sea shipping. despite the challenges of decarbonisation faced by the shipping sector, this topic has rarely been addressed in sustainability transitions studies. this paper questions common views of established firms as agents resisting change and broadens discussions on the role of incumbents and strategic reorientation. using the dynamic capabilities approach, we provide a deeper understanding of firms\\u2019 strategic reorientation over time. qualitative content analysis is applied to data from interviews, companies\\u2019 reports and observations to address questions on how and why incumbent shipping firms in the baltic sea region reoriented towards decarbonisation in 2007\\u22122018. we demonstrate that the engagement in decarbonisation has been a gradual process, characterised by a shift from reactive strategies to a mixed portfolio of integrated active and proactive innovation strategies. although firms experiment with decarbonisation through alternative energy solutions, they simultaneously continue to devote considerable attention to less radical innovations such as increased energy efficiency.\",\"unlearning in sustainability transitions: insight from two dutch community-supported agriculture farms. the importance of double-loop learning and associated unlearning for sustainability transitions is increasingly recognised; however, a clear conceptualisation and empirical focus on unlearning is lacking. this paper combines conceptualisations of unlearning in organisation, business and management theory (\\u2018organizational unlearning\\u2019) with postcolonial and feminist approaches to teaching and education (\\u2018pedagogical unlearning\\u2019) to provide a richer understanding of unlearning in sustainability transitions. empirical evidence was obtained through qualitative documentation of the conversion to solidarity payment in two dutch community-supported agriculture (csa) farms. solidarity payment increases access to the csa for low-income members and fosters solidarity with farmers to secure fairer income. our results indicate the generative function of unlearning during processes of change as well as the strategic and pedagogical relevance of unlearning for this specific case. we conclude with the added value of an approach to sustainability transitions that is equipped for capturing the entangled processes of unlearning and learning.\",\"the spatial dynamics of niche trajectory: the case of wave energy. this paper proposes that niches, as protected spaces where technologies are developed and articulated with societal needs, transcend territorial boundaries, encompassing communities and actions that span several spatial levels. to support this assertion, the paper builds on the socio-cognitive perspective to niche development and extends it, introducing a new dimension - space - thus broadening and \\\"spatializing\\\" the concept of technological niche. this framework is applied to the case of wave energy. empirical research combines a generic analysis of the construction of an \\\"overall niche space\\\" with a detailed analysis of the processes taking place in portugal, which was one of the pioneers in the emerging field. the results confirm the niche multi-spatial dynamics, showing that it is shaped by the interplay between a niche relational space constructed by actors' actions and interactions, and the territorial effects introduced by their embeddedness in particular geographical and institutional settings.\",\"governing socio-technical transitions: historical lessons from the implementation of centralized water and sewer systems in northern sweden, 1900-1950. two historical case studies are examined which address the role of public policy with respect to an important socio-technical transition of the first half of the 20th century from a swedish perspective, with clear implications for the environment and sustainability: the expansion of centralized public water and sewer systems (wss). this was carried out in the presence of significant government intervention in terms of both financial, legislative and consultative means, and involved changing norms about health and welfare in the swedish society. the analysis indicates that the cocktail of diverse governmental initiatives seems to have worked in favour for the socio-technical transition, and that this was in large due to the way government made the transition-related uncertainties and costs move from the local to the regional and national level.\",\"transformative innovation and translocal diffusion. this paper develops a conceptual understanding of transformative innovations as shared activities, ideas and objects across locally rooted sustainability initiatives that explore and develop alternatives to incumbent and (perceived) unsustainable regimes that they seek to challenge, alter or replace. we synthesize empirical work from two european research projects (transit and arts), in which initiatives and networks were empirically studied, to develop a broader conceptual understanding of the emergence of transformative innovation. the development of initiatives can occur through growing, replicating, partnering, instrumentalising and embedding. this is supported through translocal networks that connect initiatives by sharing ideas, objects and activities across local contexts. this translocal characteristic of transformative innovations harnesses an enormous potential for sustainability transitions, but requires further understanding as well as governance support. the perspective we present provides a conceptual starting point to further explore the development and diffusion of transformative innovation as well as transition governance strategies.\",\"sharing for people, planet or profit? analysing motivations for intended sharing economy participation. the sharing economy is a fast-growing and heavily debated phenomenon. this study provides an overview of motivations of people willing to participate in different forms of the sharing economy. a survey was held amongst 1330 respondents from amsterdam, the netherlands. using stated preference data, we investigate the relative importance of (1) economic, (2) social and (3) environmental motivations to participate in peer-to-peer sharing. hereby we consider differences between (a) sectors of the sharing economy, (b) socio-demographic groups, and (c) users and providers. results are descriptive as well as based on ordered logit models. notable differences are observed in the motivations for sharing between sectors. to a lesser extent there is variety in sharing drivers between socio-demographic groups. finally, users seem more economically motivated than providers of goods.\",\"the geography of sustainability transitions: contours of an emerging theme. transition research has recently been criticized to lack of geographically sensitive concepts to address sustainability transitions and environmental innovation processes. this has generated a number of suggestions how space, place and scale can be better incorporated into transitions studies. moreover, it has led to a quickly growing number of empirical studies that explicitly deal with geographical aspects of transition processes. this special issue takes stock of these recent developments by assembling a set of eight exemplary papers that illustrate the added value of an explicitly geographical perspective on sustainability transitions. the contributions include a conceptual paper, a literature review and six empirical papers that offer representative examples of recent work. taken together, these contributions testify to the vitality of the emerging research on the geography of sustainability transitions. this introduction to the special issue provides an overview of the special issue and offers suggestions for future research.\",\"the fragility of regional energy transitions. regional energy transitions are dynamic processes. in ideal-typical phase perspectives, transitions undergo \\u2018initiation\\u2019, \\u2018expansion\\u2019 and \\u2018consolidation\\u2019 phases, a linear progression towards increasing stability of the newly introduced institutions and technologies. this paper focuses on the so far underexplored fragility that may occur in the course of this process. due to their multi-scalar embedding regional transitions are highly susceptible to dynamics on the local, regional, national and international level. we systematically explore the conditions underlying this fragility by detailing socio-technical, spatial and phase-oriented aspects of energy transitions. the regional actors\\u2019 response to fragile conditions is thereby seen as crucial for the continued transition of a region. we draw upon the case of wind sector dynamics in oldenburg (germany) and find that, counter to expectations, fragility is not only a characteristic of the early stages, but in this case particularly pronounced in the apparent consolidation of the regional energy transition. the regional actors\\u2019 strategies in response, however, ensure its likely continuation.\",\"practices in transitions: review, reflections, and research directions for a practice innovation system pis approach. social practice theories (spt) can contribute to transition studies by deepening our understanding of the key social mechanisms and dynamics underpinning transitions in everyday life and the role of agency and collective action in processes of social change. several studies have applied spts with concepts from transition studies, and these connections merit attention. the review presented here shows five ways how spt are applied in studies of system change in transition studies by (i) considering change and continuity in practice elements, niches and regimes, (ii) connecting consumption and production, (iii) going beyond user practices, (iv) mapping diffusions of innovations in daily life and (v) examining policy implications and interventions. reflecting on this, i argue that the studies in the review show promises of using spt for transition studies to study system change by linking consumption and production, normality and novelty, stability and instability, micro and macro change, social and technical change, and flat and hierarchal levels. based on this and a discussion of the need for a practice paradigm of local actions in the mlp, i propose concretising the connections between spts, mlp and innovation systems approaches to form a practice innovation system framework for future research directions.\",\"the outcomes of directionality: towards a morphology of sociotechnical systems. the sustainability transitions literature departs from the idea that grand challenges such as climate change and rising inequality call for far-reaching changes in sociotechnical systems of production and consumption. this implies a dual interest in the directionality of innovation; some directions of change can be perceived as more desirable, while others may be more plausible due to the path dependent nature of sociotechnical change. the specific characteristics of the potential outcomes of directionality have, however, received little attention. our aim is therefore to unpack and conceptualize the multidimensional space in which sociotechnical systems may adopt different shapes and configurations. we also provide three illustrative empirical examples where directionality has resulted in systems with different technical, social and spatial characteristics. the ideas put forward in this paper can be seen as a contribution to a morphology of sociotechnical systems and thereby support efforts to investigate or promote specific directions of change.\",\"intermediaries in accelerating transitions: introduction to the special issue. sociotechnical transitions are complex processes that imply far-reaching technological, institutional and cultural changes. transition intermediaries have emerged as potentially powerful actors and entities to speed up transitions. as much previous literature on intermediaries in transitions has focused on emergence, in this special issue, we focus on intermediaries in the acceleration phase of transitions. the contributions address different domains, with specific focus on different parts of the energy production and consumption system. the contributions cover three themes: intermediary actors in the diffusion of new solutions, in policy change, and systemic intermediaries. we end by making three observations regarding intermediation in the acceleration of sustainability transitions: new types of stakeholders coming into transition processes requiring new forms of intermediation; contestation and tensions becoming stronger, creating new challenges for intermediaries, and; potential confusion within intermediary actors.\",\"understanding and governing learning in sustainability transitions: a review. many transitions scholars underscore the importance of learning in sustainability transitions, but the associated learning processes have hardly been conceptualised. the diverse, well-established research fields related to learning are broadly ignored or loosely applied. in this paper, we systematically explore four interesting learning traditions in terms of their value for gaining an in-depth understanding of learning in sustainability transitions and their relevance for fostering learning, by connecting them to key features of transitions. the selected learning traditions from different disciplinary backgrounds provide valuable insights. none of them sufficiently addresses the complexity of transitions. they include, however, a diversity of relevant learning contexts. we conclude that they have value for investigating new areas such as learning in socio-technological regimes and in later phases of a transition, while enlightening forms of learning that have not yet been fully recognised in transition studies, such as superficial learning, unlearning, and learning to resist change.\",\"coordination and legitimacy in the australian biofuels innovation system 1979 - 2017. like many countries, since the 1980s, australia has introduced a range of government policies to support the development of a biofuels industry. despite growth in the use of biofuels over this period industry development has not progressed to the extent seen in many of these other countries. this paper uses the technological innovation systems perspective to guide an historical event analysis of the biofuels innovation system within australia over a period of almost 40 years. results suggest two main system dynamics have been present: a series of science and technology cycles that aimed to progress biofuel technologies toward commercial competitiveness with incumbent petroleum industries; and several short lived industry development cycles that were weakened by limited market formation mechanisms and insufficient socio-political legitimation. it is concluded that the introduction of biofuel quotas in the absence of sufficient industrialisation of biofuels, while promoting some growth, undermined their effectiveness. the results are discussed in terms of the need for policy layering to support effective system development.\",\"a practical tool for analyzing socio-technical transitions. understanding socio-technical transitions, let alone managing them, is complicated. this is especially the case for many practitioners, who are commonly not well-versed in the language of transition studies but deal with transition problems on a daily basis. to make the academic knowledge on socio-technical transitions available to practitioners, we introduce the transition model canvas (tmc) as a tool for systematically mapping the key elements, and their interactions, of socio-technical transitions. based on the business model canvas (bmc) from entrepreneurship and the multi-level perspective (mlp) from transition studies, the tmc is an accessible tool that allows transition practitioners, students, and educators to evaluate and accelerate socio-technical transitions. the proposed canvas also helps further diffuse transition thinking into society and improve the quality of socio-technical policymaking and strategy development.\",\"putting the sharing economy into perspective. we develop a conceptual framework that allows us to define the sharing economy and its close cousins and we understand its sudden rise from an economic-historic perspective. we then assess the sharing economy platforms in terms of the economic, social and environmental impacts. we end with reflections on current regulations and future alternatives, and suggest a number of future research questions.\",\"social housing and low carbon transitions in ljubljana, slovenia. in the context of a growing interest on cities as agents of change for low carbon futures, there is a question about the integration of climate change concerns into municipal sectoral policies, in particular, to what extent low carbon innovations can be incorporated into social housing policies. the paper presents a case study in ljubljana (slovenia), where the municipal housing fund has implemented initiatives to advance low carbon innovation and to address energy vulnerabilities in the city. the analysis interrogates to what extent these experiments contribute to achieve a low carbon transition in ljubljana and to what effect, through the application of a framework to understand how low carbon innovations are made, maintained and lived. the analysis suggests that whilst these experimental project enable the development of alternative visions of a low carbon urban future, they should be understood within the existing contradictions of the urban landscape in ljubljana.\",\"conceptualising the systemic activities of intermediaries in sustainability transitions. this article contributes to the literature on sustainability transitions, innovation systems, and eco-innovation by addressing conceptual challenges regarding the systemic activities of intermediaries. specifically, the article addresses a research gap pertaining to the ways in which the systemic activities of (eco-)innovation intermediaries can be conceptualised and empirically demonstrated. empirically, the paper examines selected intermediaries in the context of support systems for eco-innovators in three regions across finland, germany, and sweden. drawing from our empirical findings and the literature on intermediaries, we conceptualise three system levels within which intermediation occurs: (i) in-between entities in a network, (ii) in-between networks of entities, and (iii) in-between actors, networks, and institutions. our discussion suggests a heterogeneity of roles that individual intermediaries take at multiple system levels, complementing an emerging, more nuanced perspective of intermediaries in sustainability transitions. thus, we suggest the term systemic intermediation for describing the system-level activities of intermediaries.\",\"landscape matters: insights from the impact of mega-droughts on colombia's energy transition. mega-droughts can cause disruption to the affected society sparking a transition. we explore the causes and effects of the 2015\\u22122016 mega-drought in colombia. using the multi-level perspective as a framework, we found that the mega-drought sparked an energy transition in colombia whose dynamics were impacted both by the institutionalization of niches as well as the ability to predict the next drought. we were able to trace, using the current understanding of anthropogenic forces, the cause of the mega-drought to socio-technical landscape development influenced by human-induced warming and land use change. we found that the regimes in bolivia and brazil were able to influence the landscape through deforestation, and hence contribute to the intensity of a mega-drought in colombia. the knowledge that a regime can cause disruption in regimes in other geographies and sectors has implications for transition research as well as decision-making for coping with droughts and other disasters.\",\"lead markets in 2nd generation biofuels for aviation: a comparison of germany, brazil and the usa. biofuels are the first feasible option for greenhouse gas emission reduction in aviation. this paper uses the lead markets framework to consider potential advantages in process plant required to produce 2nd generation biofuels for aviation. germany and brazil both have the potential to develop a lead market. they are active in technology development and have a demand interest through a significant aircraft and airline industry. the usa has also been found to be a country with a very high lead market potential. since the technology is at a demonstration stage, market information for the assessment of lead market advantages is not available. however, there are a range of indicators of firm activity and market potential that can be combined to make a general assessment. for this case, it is necessary for the lead market framework to be extended to consider international technology networks instead of a national lead market.\",\"contemporary financial capitalism and sustainability transitions in urban built environments. cities are considered key sites where innovation can be nurtured to drive sustainability transitions. while existing studies recognise that transitions occur unevenly across space and time, predominant theories of change offer limited understanding of the geographical conditions shaping whether and how low-carbon innovations are scaled. as sustainability practitioners and advocates increase calls for localising climate investment, this paper argues that common processes and practices constituting financial systems reveal the structuring role of contemporary capitalist finance on the forms and qualities of sustainability transitions in urban built environments. through an extensive review, the paper highlights (1) temporal boundaries associated with speculative measures of risk and return, (2) multiscalar relations of asset ownership and services provision, and (3) uneven spatial distribution of investment. acknowledging the socially regressive implications of orthodox financial thresholds, the paper considers the prospects for transformative financial innovation driven by social and place-based value propositions to meet environmental goals.\",\"functional analysis of technological innovation system with inclusion of sectoral and spatial perspectives: the case of the biogas industry in russia. this study aims to conduct a functional analysis of the technological innovation system with the inclusion of sectoral and spatial perspectives. this involves the impact analysis of a variety of sectors\\u2019 integration into the biogas value chain and a more explicit review of spatial and institutional contexts of the transition process. by applying mixed methods research, this approach is illustrated by examining the development of the biogas industry in russia. as a result, the adjusted framework enables us to understand how technological innovation develops, diffuses, and uses in specific segments and places. such an advanced insight of the analyzed case also helps to give accurate recommendations for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners, who seek to initiate or expand the diffusion of biogas technologies in russia.\",\"global pressures vs. local embeddedness: the de- and restabilization of the estonian oil shale industry in response to climate change (1995\\u20132016). existing literature on energy transitions lacks a systematic account of how the destabilization of incumbent carbon-intensive industries is influenced by their socio-spatial embeddedness on regional, national and global scales. this might result in overestimating the potential for reorientation in old industrial regions. combining the dialectic issue lifecycle (dilc) model with insights from the geography of transitions, we analyse the destabilization of the estonian oil shale industry in response to climate change between 1995 and 2016. the findings show that the embeddedness of the industry on regional and national scales, reproduced by a number of different strategies, has served as a vital source of restabilization in the face of global destabilizing pressures. policies aimed at redirecting incumbent unsustainable industries need to start from disembedding them from their socio-spatial ties.\",\"who learns what in sustainability transitions?. although learning in networks is key to transitions, the literature has juxtaposed the different actors involved. based on a conceptual review, we posit that four distinct collective actors engage in learning in transitions: technology constituencies, epistemic communities, instrument constituencies, and advocacy coalitions. technology constituencies promote the adoption of specific socio-technical alternatives by citizens, businesses, or governments. epistemic communities shed light on sustainability issues at the science-policy interface. instrument constituencies promote the creation and diffusion of specific governance arrangements. advocacy coalitions compete politically to implement their policy preferences. these collective actors are responsible for facilitating technological learning, sustainability problem learning, policy instrumental learning, and political learning, respectively, which are in turn necessary for niche development, regime destabilization, overcoming path dependence, and political change. consequently, the alignment of these distinct, albeit potentially overlapping, collective actors can have a profound impact on learning in transitions and the emergence of transition pathways.\",\"an intermediary approach to technological innovation systems (tis)\\u2014the case of the cleantech sector in finland. the technological innovation system (tis) framework has become a popular tool for the analysis of innovation dynamics, particularly on a national scale. there have been calls to utilise the framework at sub-national levels too, and to pay attention to location-specific features and interactions. this article contributes to the discussion by studying how the sub-national intermediary network of the finnish carbon-neutral municipalities (hinku) complements and challenges the national cleantech innovation system in finland. to achieve this, we propose an analytical framework that combines the tis framework with intermediary functions. our study shows that the tis framework is a practical tool for analysing potential discontinuities and policy development possibilities regarding innovation systems across spatial scales. empirically, the study reveals the ways in which certain technological innovation system functions, such as market formation and experimentation, are particularly important for local-scale cleantech deployment and should be analysed further.\",\"de-centering transitions: low-carbon innovation from the peripheries. socio-technical transitions have garnered significant attention in recent years. both in theory and practice, however, concerns have been raised about the elitist character of low-carbon transitions. such dynamics are predominantly imagined through core-periphery relationships. more recently, calls to \\u2018decentre\\u2019 transitions draw attention to the social and spatial dynamics of transitions in the peripheries. recognizing and fostering transitions from the peripheries offers important opportunities for progressing low-carbon innovation in practice and opens the door to deeper structural transformations. this perspective must nevertheless acknowledge the risk of transitions creating new core-periphery dependencies and reinforcing the strength of elites.\",\"innovation challenges of utilities in informal settlements: combining a capabilities and regime perspective. the provision of basic services is falling short in informal settlements of cities in the global south. in particular, public utilities have had difficulties expanding their services to the urban poor. why is this the case despite utilities having improved their capabilities substantially over the last years? this paper investigates how innovation strategies of utilities are aligned or misaligned with the broader contexts in informal settlements, which are populated by different socio-technical regimes. we propose a framework to identify new capabilities needed by utilities to deal with these different regimes. the paper reconstructs pro-poor initiatives of a water and sewerage utility in a large east-african city and explains why they tended to fail in terms of livelihood improvement. we show how the alignment between capability portfolios and specific regime structures have set limits to the success of pro-poor innovation strategies in informal settlement contexts.\",\"explaining regime destabilisation in the pulp and paper industry. a transition to a carbon neutral society will require a shift from fossil to renewable resources. this will affect the conversion of biomass and related industries such as the pulp and paper industry. the purpose of this paper is two-fold: first, to describe and analyse the transformation processes in the swedish pulp and paper industry and the adoption of biorefinery options, and second, to demonstrate how conceptualisations from strategic management can be used to describe regime destabilisation. the industry's adoption of biorefinery options has been modest so far, but there is development along two trajectories. the first centres on gasification and the second on separation and refining. such diverging strategies in response to external pressure can be explained by differences that exist between firms. signs of increasing firm divergence, or 'regime fragmentation', might indicate the entry into a phase of regime destabilisation, and a critical point in a transition.\",\"conditions for the deliberate destabilisation of established industries: lessons from u.s. tobacco control policy and the closure of dutch coal mines. this paper contributes to recent developments in the literature concerning the need to destabilise existing industries. challenging established industries through policy can be politically difficult. the purpose of the paper is to draw lessons from examples of the policy-driven destabilisation of established industries and from that, gain a better understanding of which conditions deliberate destabilisation might be possible under. the analytical framework draws together insights from the multilevel perspective and policy process theory. two historical cases are analysed: the introduction of tobacco control policies in the united states and the decision to close down coal mines in the netherlands. in its concluding sections, the paper discusses factors that lead to network change, particularly attending to how tensions within key organisations may lead to changes in alliances and thus provide opportunities for phase-out policies.\",\"energy, complexity, and sustainability: a historical perspective. the common view of history assumes that complexity and resource consumption have emerged through innovation facilitated by surplus energy. this view leads to the supposition that complexity and consumption are voluntary, and that we can therefore achieve a sustainable future through conservation. such an assumption is substantially incorrect. history suggests that complexity most commonly increases to solve problems, and compels increase in resource use. this process is illustrated by the history of the roman empire and its collapse. problems are inevitable, requiring increasing complexity, and conservation is therefore insufficient to produce sustainability. future sustainability will require continued high levels of energy consumption to address converging problems.\",\"sustainability framings of accommodation sharing. the existing research often overlooks the fact that accommodation sharing is not a homogeneous sector but comprises rental, reciprocal and free platforms. this paper aims to compare sustainability narratives held by operators and users of the three platform types with the narratives identified in the literature. first, drawing on framing theory, environmental, economic and social framings of accommodation sharing are mapped based on the extant literature and expert interviews. second, sustainability framings of operators and users from the three types of accommodation sharing platforms are presented. the data is collected via 10 in-depth interviews and 86 responses to a qualitative structured online questionnaire. we find that current framings of sustainability implications of accommodation sharing vary among those who formulate them as well as among the three platform types. this has implications for the role of these platforms in advancing different types of sustainability.\",\"user innovation, niche construction and regime destabilization in heat pump transitions. domestic heating systems require a rapid shift to low-carbon options to meet global climate targets. we analyse a heat pump transition in two contrasting case studies: finland and the united kingdom, utilizing original data from interviews, document analysis, and archival online data. finland has an almost completed transition, while the united kingdom can be considered a stalled one. building on previous research that has highlighted the importance of context, policy and users in transitions, we explore various user roles within low-carbon transitions, and how they shape processes of niche construction and regime destabilisation. our findings show that the role of users is one key explanatory element of the different heat pump transitions. we also find that specific characteristics of a transition context can influence the types of users that emerge. we conclude that instead of just providing incentives, policy should also aim to mobilise users.\",\"creating actionable knowledge one step at a time: an analytical framework for tracing systems and agency in niche innovation pathways. we present a practice-oriented analytical framework that supports the generation of actionable knowledge for practice and policy actors to facilitate sustainable niche innovations to emerge and mature. originating from an applied research context, the framework combines and operationalises existing transition-related concepts and frameworks to build on their respective strengths and make them more relevant for practice. the framework facilitates tracing the development pathways of niche innovations from system-centred and agency-centred perspectives to yield insights into both the complex dynamics of innovation processes and the options for actions by different actors. we apply the framework to three cases of innovative coupled infrastructures in germany and reflect on the extent to which these gauged actionable knowledge. far from being a silver bullet to realising transformative change, making theoretical frameworks applicable to practice, and applying them in collaborative ways is nevertheless an important step when aiming to generate actionable knowledge for sustainability transitions.\",\"lessons for model use in transition research: a survey and comparison with other research areas. the use of models to study the dynamics of transitions is challenging because of several aspects of transitions, notably complexity, multi-domain and multi-level interactions. these challenges are shared by other research areas that extensively make use of models. in this article we survey experiences and methodological approaches developed in the research areas of social-ecological modeling, integrated assessment, and environmental modeling, and derive lessons to be learnt for model use in transition studies. in order to account for specific challenges associated with different kinds of model applications we classify models according to their uses: for understanding transitions, for providing case-specific policy advice, and for facilitating stakeholder processes. the assessment reveals promising research directions for transition modeling, such as model-to-model analysis, pattern-oriented modeling, advanced sensitivity analysis, development of a shared conceptual framework, and use of modeling protocols.\",\"policy and community-led action on sustainability and climate change: paradox and possibility in the interstices. this commentary relates findings reported in this collection to personal and collective experiences within ecolise, a unique experiment in creating a common platform for networking, collaboration, learning and policy influence representing multiple national and international networks of cbis. the establishment of ecolise has raised numerous challenges identical or parallel to those faced by cbis and reported elsewhere in this collection: risks of co-optation by established policy actors, the need to develop new operational processes in multiple areas simultaneously and without direct precedents on which to build, and the paradoxical position of operating within the very same structures it seeks to change. these issues have a common source in tensions between conventional forms of social process and collaborative cultures and those emerging from community-led action and prefiguring the social goals of cbis. lessons from experiences within ecolise can thus complement and further illuminate findings from research on and with cbis.\",\"designing the public sector to promote sustainability transitions: institutional principles and a case study of arpa-e. sustainability transition perspectives justify policies tailored to technological innovation systems and socio-technical niches and regimes. these \\u201ctechnology-specific\\u201d policies place high demands on the capabilities of the state. this paper examines how public sector institutions can be designed and operated to avoid potential pitfalls and effectively implement technology-specific policies. the paper presents a list of ten institutional design principles and their relation to sustainability transition studies. how the principles are achieved in practice and how they interact within a governance system is then explored through a case study of the advanced research projects agency-energy (arpa-e) in the united states. the case demonstrates that an organization's formal and informal rules can make the design principles mutually reinforcing, while a stronger political consensus is needed to manage tensions between accountability and stability. the institutional design principles can inform future case studies exploring how the state implements technology specific policy in different contexts.\",\"pinning it down? measuring innovation for sustainability transitions. sustainability transitions require shifts in multiple social systems, practices, and institutions. different innovation perspectives are essential for achieving and understanding transitions. they range from actor-oriented (organizational innovation management, regional innovation ecosystems) to mode-oriented (responsible innovation, mission-driven innovation) to process-oriented (social innovation) perspectives. for sustainability transitions to be governed, we need a better understanding of how the relevant contributions of innovations can be measured. in this article, we review the status of measurement across the different innovation perspectives. we find that measurement status becomes weaker as we move from actor-oriented to process-oriented innovations. to address this shortcoming, we then develop a conceptual approach for measuring social innovation. thereby, we integrate organizational innovation capacities and regional contexts with the transformational elements of social innovation. we discuss how such an integrated and multi-level approach to measurement enhances our understanding of social innovations and, in particular, their contributions to sustainability transitions. we contribute to the sustainability transitions literature by tying it to different innovation perspectives and by conceptualizing new innovation mechanisms that drive transformations. we add to social innovation theory by specifying its role in change toward sustainability and advancing it to a measurable construct relevant to governance and policymaking.\",\"system dynamics modelling and simulation for sociotechnical transitions research. sociotechnical transitions is an emerging research area that uses several methods, amongst which case study and simulation models are often applied. this paper focuses on system dynamics modelling and simulation research and its potential contribution to transition research. current system dynamics work comes from a wide range of disciplines and spans across the micro, meso, and macro levels which transitions are predominantly analysed along. this overlap carries considerable potential as a conceptual and theoretical basis for transition research. the paper explores this potential and provides a cursory exposition of system dynamics research and exemplary work that is directly relevant to transition research. it raises a number of points that indicate the potential of system dynamics for transition research in terms of methodology and case study research, the behavioural aspects of transitions, and particular subject areas that lie at the organizational field level: technology platforms, business models and organizational change.\",\"the \\u2018bioeconomics vs bioeconomy\\u2019 debate: beyond criticism, advancing research fronts. the case for solving the environmental crisis through a bioeconomic transition is gaining momentum. however, aims and content of such a transition remain unclear, as this could target an economic sector, the analysis of economic activities, or society as a whole, especially in its relationship to the biosphere. this last possible object of transition \\u2013 society \\u2013 is where values, models and goals come into conflict. this study examines this controversy through the lens of the \\u2018bioeconomics vs bioeconomy\\u2019 debate, in which proponents of bioeconomics have raised an arsenal of critiques against what they consider the simplistic promises of public and private promoters of the bioeconomy. we discuss these critiques, which are mainly macro in scale and/or narrative-centred, and argue for a complementary research effort that supports transition initiatives. this research could take place on three fronts: better understanding bioeconomic systems, evaluating bioeconomic transitions, and identifying how to implement these transitions.\",\"societal transformation through the prism of the concept of territoire: a french contribution. driven by the need for radical change in our practices and values to escape crises, studies on sustainability transitions have multiplied in recent years. such radical transformations are situated in space. a spatial approach towards transformative processes can thus inform about the conditions and contexts of such dynamics. recent publications on the geography of transition tackle this issue but still give little importance to the constructed and relational nature of place that frames interactions between niche, regime and landscape. this paper presents a conceptual framework for the spatial analysis of transformation dynamics by adopting the french-speaking literature on territoire. we attempt to show that the conceptualisation of space through the french territorial lens appears highly relevant in the study of sustainability transitions, notably because the concept of territoire allows to grasp three fundamental dimensions of transformation (the material, institutional and ideal dimension) and their interactions. it thus enables studying transformation dynamics in a systemic manner. furthermore, this concept allows researchers to grasp multiple and intertwined power relationships involved in transformation processes by tackling governance issues through the spatial lens.\",\"incumbents' enabling role in niche-innovation: power dynamics in a wastewater project. more pluralised understandings of incumbencies are often overlooked in transitions research, which may lead to underestimating the enabling roles of incumbents in niche projects. this study explores these roles by applying a power framework to five struggles revolving around a path-breaking decentralised wastewater treatment project in the city of ghent (belgium). remarkably, incumbents from multiple regimes use power to enable the niche project. the study identifies and discusses four patterns in the enabling role of incumbents in niche projects. these patterns are clarified by focussing on incumbents from multiple regimes, belonging to local authorities, neighbouring and more distant regimes, as well as on the power of structural trends related to the urgency of sustainability challenges. as such, the study contributes to the understanding of multiple incumbencies and the conditions under which these may reinforce niche projects. for practitioners, the study underscores the role of power dynamics in the water/wastewater sector.\",\"how do incumbent companies\\u2019 heterogeneous responses affect sustainability transitions? insights from china's major incumbent power generators. transitions research has often been unintentionally biased toward novelty and assumes incumbents as homogeneous groups that are \\u201clocked-in\\u201d to certain sociotechnical regimes. in reality, incumbents are heterogeneous at the company and industrial levels and thus have heterogeneous responses that can both accelerate and deter sustainability transitions. to fill the research gap, this paper explores the determinants of such heterogeneous responses and insights for sustainability transitions, taking china's major incumbent power generators as its case study. the results are: first, incumbent companies respond heterogeneously if firm-specific, socioeconomic, and institutional factors give different opportunities and barriers. policy feedback effects and development of complementarities in infrastructure, instruments, and organizational elements can increase heterogeneous responses. second, their heterogeneous responses can accelerate sustainability transitions if they go beyond destabilization of regime, legitimization of alternative policy instruments, and development of infrastructure and institutions that trigger co-evolution with socioeconomic and institutional factors.\",\"environmental innovation and societal transitions: introduction and overview. this article introduces the new journal environmental innovation and societal transitions (eist). we consider its key terms and offer a survey of relevant theoretical and empirical insights, policy issues and research challenges. four theoretical approaches to studying sustainability transitions are identified. the treatise ends with a synopsis of the 19 articles in this inaugural issue and a list of suggested research themes.\",\"whose transformation is this? unpacking the \\u2018apparatus of capture\\u2019 in sweden's bioeconomy. this study investigates how and by whom the swedish (forest) bioeconomy has been shaped so far. we unpack emerging bioeconomies as discursive constructs and use the \\u2018apparatus of capture\\u2019 as a conceptual framework to understand and rethink the swedish bioeconomy. based on analysis of empirical data from multiple sources (e.g., online surveys, in-depth interviews, participatory observations), we identify a closed bioeconomy network structure that includes forest industries, major forest owner associations, regional councils and research institutes/universities. the network (re)produces three key storylines that appeal to the majority of parties in the national parliament, defines the boundaries of relevant expertise, and discredits environmental regulation and expertise. through these storylines the swedish bioeconomy is turned into an issue of innovation governance, which blurs the boundaries between public and private interests in forests. to counteract future capture, different types of knowledges and forest perspectives need further exploration in swedish bioeconomy and forest governance.\",\"governance of the circular economy: a comparative examination of the use of standards by china and the united kingdom. wastes, like other materials, have become increasingly global in their flows. the circular economy (ce) is a multi-level sustainability transition linked to the global trade in waste. china has long been a key trading partner for the west's waste materials. however, its rethinking of the quality of traded recyclable materials has triggered a crisis in the global governance of waste flows. we utilise a sociology of knowledge approach to undertake comparative work to better understand how different governance arrangements may facilitate or constrain the unfolding of a ce transition. the uk and china were selected as models of liberal and authoritarian environmental governance respectively. a mixed-method approach was pursued using qualitative interviews with key stakeholders and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from secondary sources. thematic analysis is organised around: perceptions of the circular economy, meanings of standards, and perspectives on trade and materials.\",\"radical change and deep transitions: lessons from europe's infrastructure transition 1815\\u20132015. schot and kanger (2016) argue that the shift from an unsustainable to a sustainable society requires radical historical change in the form of a deep transition: \\u201ca series of connected transitions in many socio-technical systems [e.g. energy, mobility, food] towards a similar direction [e.g. sustainability].\\u201d they call for more research. in response, this paper discusses a historical deep transition. it tracks the connected histories of europe's mobility, food supply, warfare, and ecological systems, all of which experienced a transnational infrastructure transition in the 19th and 20th centuries. studying these connected histories as a \\u2018deep\\u2019 infrastructure transition highlights important dynamics of radical historical change. this paper also adds to schot and kanger's research agenda, highlighting: (1) the importance of studying actors in deep transitions\\u2014particularly \\u2018system entanglers\\u2019 who interweave various sociotechnical systems and thereby connect transitions; (2) how such actors produced convergence, but also divergence across connected transitions; (3) the extreme unpredictability of deep transitions due to such divergences; and (4) the need for reflexivity regarding the analyst's role in delineating deep transitions, so as to avoid essentialism and the uncritical reproduction of contemporary

narratives, and national policy: how india developed off-grid solar for rural electrification. decentralized renewables are critical for rural electrification in many countries in the global south. as a case study of the development of decentralized renewables, we trace the evolution of india's off-grid solar sector from 1980 through 2020. we apply the multi-level perspective (mlp) to highlight interactions across three levels of actors, with additional attention to how their actions were shaped by evolving policy narratives. we find that the national government initiated the development of off-grid solar in the early 1980s due to concerns about energy security and rural poverty. the sector was then supported by international agencies focused on sustainable development, and more recently non-state players and private enterprise emerged as the innovators. this case study makes two more general contributions to the mlp literature. empirically, it shows how regime actors can deliberately create niches. theoretically, it shows how narrative analysis can be integrated into the mlp to shed light on the dynamics of energy transitions.\",\"hard coal phase-out and the labour market transition pathways: the case of poland. we study the labour market transition pathways driven by the coal phase-out in poland between 1990 and 2050. we apply the concept of branching points to describe the coal transition in the context of structural and labour supply changes and educational upgrading. we show that in the 1990s and 2000s, job opportunities for miners were scarce, as the trajectories of all of these trends deteriorated their labour market prospects. as these trends have reversed in the 2010s, the future employment outlook of the coal phase-out in poland is more favourable than it was in the past. we find that the employment structures of mining subregions and mines are homogenous, which enables regional approaches to manage the transition. decarbonisation will lead to a surplus of polish hard coal mining workers from 2030 on, yet the projected shortages of workers in other sectors will create opportunities for reallocation.\",\"saskatchewan's energy future: risk and pathways analysis. literature on socio-technical transitions acknowledge that negative risk perception is important to socio-technical transitions. this article argues that beyond identifying risk as a potential barrier, the acceptance or rejection of innovative options because of risks is a predictor of the transition pathway being adopted. this article analyses discussions from citizen's jury sessions held in three saskatchewan cities to identify how local citizens perceive risk in low carbon base-load technologies. it shows how risk analysis influence choices of power generation technologies, which in turn influence energy systems transition pathways in saskatchewan. it finds that in saskatchewan, a history of usage and consumption, rather than cost or technical risk, is the strongest factor influencing people's perception and tolerance of risk in innovative technologies in the energy sector, allowing for options such as carbon capture and storage (ccs) to be deployed.\",\"power transmission: where the offshore wind energy comes home. a rich literature exists on benefits of community involvement and believed effects of offshore wind power structures, but little is known about how the public perceives electricity transmission via submarine power cables. yet, it is when transmission comes ashore that residents most acutely come face to face with offshore wind. in two u.s. communities we elicited early reactions to submarine power cables using in-person interviews and a mail survey. results indicate the public is relatively unfamiliar with potential risks or benefits, yet concerns emerged regarding conflicts with ocean users (especially the fishing community) and human health and safety, although others expect benefits and most expect no effect. residents prefer cables to connect to land under \\u201cnatural\\u201d areas rather than inhabited coastal areas. further, strong majorities prefer a submarine power cable network with few shore connections compared to each wind project installing its own cable, with more cable connections to land.\",\"advocacy coalitions in the acceleration phase of the european energy transition. actors play a key role in promoting or hindering sustainability transitions and their positions and the coalitions they form may adjust during this long-term process. literature widely recognizes the importance of coalitions to create legitimacy and build support for sustainability transitions. the question of how coalitions change in the third, acceleration phase of a transition has, however, remained insufficiently explored. this paper analyses advocacy coalitions in the acceleration phase of the european energy transition and sheds light on the dynamics between niche and regime level actors when the transition is already well underway. whereas earlier studies identified one renewable energy coalition, we find three distinct coalitions in the eu's electricity policy system that support the transition but with preferences for different policy instruments. our study shows that rather than coalition decline and growth, the ongoing development involves the emergence of new coalitions and new alliances between them.\",\"modernization of russian district heating systems with the help of biomass energy \\u2013 a gordian knot?. the article discusses the prospects of local wood waste resources as replacements for fossil fuel imports in the remote settlements of the russian north from a viewpoint of a case study: the arkhangelsk region and its outdated heating and fossil fuel delivery systems. drawing on energy transition literature and expert interviews, the most influential factors are defined in geographic-infrastructural, institutional, financial, and behavioral contexts. in conclusion, the article determines that a key issue is that the constraints for alternative energy sources reinforce each other, while the actors working for them find themselves in an isolated position. this is especially true for the institutional and financial constraints. however, by examining the enabling factors it is possible to see how the bundle of constraints could also be undone together. most efficient way for success would likely be helping municipalities and actors in the fields of biomass and energy production to form joint clusters and share resources.\",\"trust and cooperation among urban poor for transition to cleaner and modern cooking fuel. a significant percentage of households in india still use firewood, kerosene and other biomass as cooking fuel. a survey on household energy consumption patterns in hyderabad revealed that monthly expenditure of urban poor on firewood or kerosene is as much as the price of liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) cylinder. however, poorer households do not switch to lpg due to the high initial investments for an lpg connection. a pilot project was initiated to explore the viability of a community-based cooperative solution in pooling financial resources to meet these upfront investment costs and enable slum households to shift from kerosene and firewood to lpg. two self-help groups were formed comprising 30 households each. the project enabled all 60 member households to obtain an lpg connection. this paper reiterates, through this pilot, that it is possible for communities themselves to come up with innovative and sustainable solutions for achieving common development goals.\",\"the crisis in employment and consumer demand: reconciliation with environmental sustainability. this paper argues that a sustainable industrial system depends not only on good environmental and public health outcomes, but also on adequate employment and earning capacity in a wellfunctioning and equitable economic system. these concerns are likely to dominate future national political debates, requiring responses that increase the earning capacity of individuals through changes in the nature of work and employment, and in the ownership of productive capital. making the economy greener, while certainly necessary for long-term economic and societal survival, does not necessarily mean more and better paying jobs on a large enough scale to make serious progress to reducing unemployment and underemployment. at present, national and global reforms are focused on improving the financial system, which is not synonymous with reforming the economic system or improving the economic status of individual citizens. this paper discusses specific policies and initiatives that need to be considered to ensure sustainable employment and livelihoods.\",\"\\u201cmaking energy transition work\\u201d: bricolage in austrian regions\\u2019 path-creation. in the quest for energy transition pathways, energy regions have become the instrument of choice in peripheralized austrian regions. this paper unveils why \\u201clocked-in\\\" regions usually struggling with systemic change can still create alternative paths. based on the bricolage concept and the asid heuristic, we develop a framework to examine the transition processes of three austrian energy regions (g\\u00fcssing, hermagor, murau). the case studies illustrate the significance of bricolage in mobilizing agential, structural, institutional and discursive resources towards regional path-creation, and show how strategic agents skillfully assemble these resources to mold the transition process in their favor. we thus conclude that (1) the bricolage approach can be a valuable analytical lens for all aspects of regional development in \\u201clocked-in\\u201d regions, and (2) the energy regions instrument reinforces existing power structures, suggesting why inclusive energy transitions might still fail despite resourceful and robust plans.\",\"climate-change induced uncertainties, risks and opportunities for the coal-based region of silesia: stakeholders' perspectives. transformation of coal-dependent regions in the european union has received much lower research interest than industry decarbonisation. moreover, even if territorial strategies are proposed, positive aspects are highlighted, while the risks are neglected or not addressed explicitly. in this context, we explore transition stakeholders\\u2019 beliefs and perception about political, economic, social, environmental and technological risks and opportunities for the coal-dependent region of silesia (poland) \\u2013 the largest european coal region. a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary assessment of risks and opportunities demonstrates that all stakeholders but ngos consider the consequences of climate change-induced uncertainties unambiguously negative. the territorial analysis of silesian counties based on the prevalent vulnerability index scoring shows that virtually all counties with the ongoing coal mining activity are expected to face difficulties with adapting to changes.\",\"transitions in unlikely places: exploring the conditions for renewable energy adoption in nigeria. this paper examines conditions and pathways that explain variation in the adoption of renewable energy (re) in nigeria's 36 states based on a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. using three analytical lenses proposed by the multi-level socio-technical theory (niches, regimes, and landscapes), we examine re adoption in these states. while all three lenses explain variation to some extent, a combination of regime and landscape characteristics, enables states to overcome dependence on oil while triggering the adoption of re. states with high income and a regime featuring institutions and coalitions supporting transitions establish themselves as pioneers. states with medium/low income and a regime characterised by a weak pro-re political coalition support emerge as laggards. hence we conclude that the role of the regime and particularly political actors therein, is central in energy transition processes among nigerian states. this has implications for future transition attempts in nigeria and developing (rentier) countries, generally.\",\"the emerging funding gap for the european energy sector - will the financial sector deliver?. in the eu policy debate, there is an emerging understanding of the existence of a substantial gap between current investment levels and those required to reach the 2020 energy targets. for energy supply and transmission alone, the gap is estimated to be almost \\u20ac500 billion. bridging this funding gap requires the financial sector to supply the capital needed by firms in their entrepreneurial activities. over the last thirty years, the financial sector has, however, shifted its focus towards speculative and high-risk financial investments with short periods of investment and high returns. it is quite plausible that the ability of the eu to bridge the funding gap and realise the desired process of schumpeterian \\\"creative destruction\\\" in the energy sector will be constrained by this shift. we conclude that an adequate mobilisation of financial resources may require public investments to be greatly increased and/or a reform of the financial system.\",\"a review of linking models and socio-technical transitions theories for energy and climate solutions. in the last decade, a new strand of energy and climate research emerged that links quantitative models and socio-technical transitions theories or frameworks. linking the two enables capturing the co-evolution of society, technology, the economy and the environment. we systematically review this literature (n = 44) and describe the papers\\u2019 trends, scope, temporal and spatial foci, and methodological strategies. the reviewed literature aspires to find solutions to the energy and climate challenges, to increase realism in models and theories, and to enable interdisciplinary learning between the two scholarly communities. the outcomes in this literature show benefits of interdisciplinary learning between modellers and transitions theorists. however, the literature rarely identified practical insights for energy and climate solutions or for improving realism in models and theories. we conclude by suggesting that integrative research should be continued, but redirected to provide more practical outcomes to meet energy and climate targets.\",\"a just transition for coal miners? community identity and support from local policy actors. the u.s. energy system is currently undergoing significant transition as unconventional drilling technologies have drastically increased the volume of natural gas and oil produced domestically, the cost of renewables has declined, and coal production has plummeted. scholars and activists have increasingly argued for a just transition policy framework to assist displaced coal miners. in this analysis, we consider support for just transition policies among local policy actors in the mountain west region, focusing on the role of accountability and community economic identity. results suggest that policies to assist displaced coal miners enjoy broad support among local policy actors, indicating that comprehensive program to assist communities and workers negatively impacted by the energy transition might be politically possible.\",\"beyond the north-south divide: the political economy and multi-level governance of international low-carbon technology transfer in china. the rapid rise of emerging economies challenges the conventional understanding of international low-carbon technology transfer (iltt) from a north-south perspective. rather than acting like passive recipients of foreign investment and technology, actors in emerging economies have become more assertive, seeking control over the processes of iltt. to understand this emerging trend, this paper conceptualizes iltt as political-economic and multi-level governance processes involving two key elements\\u2014partnership building and technology adaptation. the empirical findings, drawing from a case study on the transfer of the passive house concept from germany to china, show that the priorities of domestic rather than foreign actors have defined the scope for collaboration and the purpose of the technology, resulting in the adoption of a version of the technology that best serves domestic political-economic interests. these findings suggest that iltt is becoming increasingly complex geographically, which opens new perspectives into the spatial dimension of socio-technical transitions.\",\"the politics of niche-regime conflicts: distributed solar energy in the united states. in the u.s. utilities have attempted to slow the growth of distributed generation (dg) solar by reversing policy support, and they have greater financial and political resources than the solar industry. empirical analysis of all major cases of niche-regime conflict over net metering policies in the u.s. shows that utilities are testing a range of strategies to slow the growth of dg solar, and outcomes vary by strategy type. an additional analysis of four case studies of dg solar conflicts shows that niche organizations can partially overcome the political power of regime organizations via three mechanisms: form coalitions with political parties that support the niche technologies, gain support from countervailing industrial organizations, and form coalitions with social movements to mobilize political protests and petitions. the political opportunity structure (in this case the party in control of the state government) affects the pattern of niche-regime strategies and interactions.\",\"risk-benefit perceptions and public acceptance of carbon capture and utilization. carbon capture and utilization (ccu) as low-carbon technology has the potential to reduce the use of fossil resources and co2-emissions. public protests against carbon capture and storage showed that a successful rollout of low-carbon technologies requires social acceptance. the present study explores the relationship between risk and benefit perceptions and the perceived uncontrollability of the technology to predict the general and local acceptance of ccu, based on structural equation modeling. perceived benefits (savings of fossil resources and co2-emissions) were positively associated with affective benefit evaluations, which were the highest predictors of general ccu-acceptance. risk perceptions were positively related to affective risk evaluations, which predicted local ccu-acceptance. perceived uncontrollability was negatively related to ccu-perceptions and acceptance. the findings highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between perceived uncontrollability, risk and benefit perceptions, and resulting social acceptance of ccu. implications to promote a socially acceptable deployment of low-carbon technologies were derived.\",\"relating financial systems to sustainability transitions: challenges, demands and design features. the paris climate agreement, sustainable development goals and addis ababa action agenda call for the financial system to be \\u201cconsistent and integrated\\u201d in its response to the sustainability and climate breakdown. sustainability transitions research (str) and orthodox finance literature are failing to engage with these calls. this paper offers three contributions to address this issue. firstly, it scopes the sustainability-related finance literature and finds broad but fragmented research strands with limited critical analysis and little cross-engagement with str. secondly, the paper draws on insights from str and international climate and sustainable development agreements to propose a transition demand framework that characterises the explicit demands that sustainability transitions place on the financial system (understood as intermediaries, markets and infrastructure). thirdly, the paper considers essential design features for financial systems to meet the specific demands of sustainability transitions and identifies critical questions for broadening research in this area.\",\"the bulgarian nuclear sector in transition: adopted russian technology, state sovereignty and accession to the eu. applying the notion of \\u2018orders of worth\\u2019 (l. boltanski, l. th\\u00e9venot), the paper explores the technology & policy challenges the bulgarian nuclear energy sector faced from the mid-1980s to the early 2000s. emerging after the 1960s based on soviet technology and under soviet political domination, it had to adapt to the new conditions set by the winners of the cold war and to the pressure of local green movements. key events included the completion of the second 1000 mw soviet nuclear reactor at the kozloduy nuclear power plant (npp), the termination of work on the belene npp (1990\\u20131991), and the painful decommissioning under eu pressure of the four old 440 mw reactors (2004\\u20132006). the paper traces the public debates during these developments, the resources used by the actors to justify their behavior and draws conclusions about the peculiarities of emerging \\u2018technical democracies\\u2019 in eastern europe.\",\"designing industrial strategy for a low carbon transformation. the recent re-emergence of industrial policy as a legitimate pursuit of governments in europe and the us has the potential to open up a new realm of policy action for climate change mitigation. this would aim to align efforts to secure national industrial opportunities with the development of low carbon industrial systems, so as to generate both socio-economic and environmental benefits. the paper discusses the role of low carbon industrial strategy in seeking to do this, thereby accelerating transitions to a low carbon economy. it sets out the elements of a more systemic low carbon industrial strategy, including providing a mission-oriented and learning-based approach, drawing on and combining insights from neo-schumpeterian and ecological economics perspectives.\",\"renewable energy and transition-periphery dynamics in scotland. scotland is being transformed as renewable energy resources are being exploited through new developments and infrastructure as part of an energy transition. scotland has a significant amount of potential onshore and offshore renewable energy available for capture largely located in rural and remote regions. this paper extends the \\u2018transition-periphery\\u2019 approach developed by murphy and smith (2013) and applies it to a set of case study sites in scotland. this empirical analysis highlights the geographical dynamics being created by the renewable energy transition in scotland. the results suggest that complex transition-periphery dynamics are being created by renewable energy development in scotland in which infrastructure, ownership, and scale have particularly important roles in shaping the transition. this study highlights the need for further research that focuses on resource peripheries in sociotechnical transitions.\",\"is social cohesion decisive for energy cooperatives existence? a quantitative analysis. energy cooperatives (ecoops), the most prominent example for energy communities, are attributed great importance for the energy transition both through the engagement of energy end-consumers and the increase of local renewable energy sources. we conducted an exploratory (spatial) data analysis to study which indicators of the european social progress index and quality of life index co-occure with the presence of ecoops. results show that these indexes and most of their sub-components present values significantly better at the regions where the ecoops are located compared to all eu regions. while correlation and regression coefficients between the number of ecoops per region and the indexes are relatively small, the individual indicator \\u201clife-long learning\\u201d reaches the highest correlation and explanatory values. additionally, global moran statistics show that the concentration of ecoops and their relation to the indexes in space are rather random but a local analysis shows clusters emerging throughout the continent.\",\"overcoming the harmony fallacy: how values shape the course of innovation systems. the technological innovation systems (tis) framework is one of the dominant perspectives in transitions studies to analyze success conditions and system failures of newly emerging technologies and industries. so far, tis studies mostly adopted a rather harmonious view on the values of actors and by this were unable to address competition, conflicts and, in particular, battles over diverging directionalities within the system. to empirically assess this potential \\u201charmony fallacy\\u201d, we identify values as part of underlying institutional logics of major organizations in the field of modular water technologies in switzerland by means of 26 expert interviews. we show how logics may condition collaboration patterns and technological preferences. this analysis inspires key conceptual tasks of innovation system analysis, like the identification of system failures, the setting of appropriate system boundaries and the formulation of better policy recommendations.\",\"complexity challenges for transition policy: lessons from coastal shipping in norway. this policy briefing discusses decarbonization policies of \\u201chard-to-abate\\u201d sectors, emphasizing the implications of these sectors\\u2019 complexity. specifically, we discuss two sources of complexity: (a) heterogeneity in the form of variation across and within technologies and user segments and (b) interdependencies between technologies (within and between their value chains) and between user segments and adopter groups. based on research on coastal shipping in norway, a global frontrunner in decarbonization of this sector, we suggest three guiding principles for developing policy mixes for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors: (1) employ technology-specific policies but aim at broad sectoral or general policies when suitable, (2) consider value chain interdependency and user segment heterogeneity when prioritizing technologies and user segments, and (3) translate (rather than transfer) successful policies to other settings (e.g. user segments).\",\"mexico's renewable energy innovation system: geothermal and solar photovoltaics case study. this paper evaluates the impact of changes in mexican energy policies on the mexican innovation systems ability to support renewable energy technologies, through a comparative case study on geothermal and solar photovoltaic technologies. the study examines the effectiveness of government policy in each case by exploring how changes in policy have affected the development of their respective innovation systems. the analysis is facilitated by a technology innovation system framework. the main source of data is primary data from an online survey of 61 experienced energy experts in mexico in 2019, complemented with desktop research. results suggest that changes in government priorities have a strong influence on the development of these two technologies. the development of these technologies in mexico is determined by their innovation systems resilience and adaptability to the changing policy landscape. policy instruments that encourage knowledge formation serve as critical for the continued development of renewable energy technologies in mexico. this study contributes to the literature on innovation systems in mexico, on comparing two renewable energy technologies, and on developing countries policy and innovation contexts.\",\"the power of power markets: zonal market designs in advancing energy transitions. electricity market design becomes increasingly important with growing shares of renewable energy in the electricity system. this article examines zonal market designs and their compatibility with ongoing energy transitions, focusing on two types of zonal market designs: the nordic market with numerous, smaller zones, and the german \\u201ccopper plate approach\\u201d with one, national zone. it assesses the dominant ideas and institutional logics within the two market designs. perceptions of what kind of market design works best and is most efficient vary significantly, in line with the roles and interests of dominant stakeholders. overall, the nordic market is found to be better aligned with the energy transition in terms of flexibility, portfolio effects and system costs. the german market has considerably higher system costs but provides better conditions for long-term trading.\",\"evaluation of energy storage technologies for integration with renewable electricity: quantifying expert opinions. solving climate change and the associated need for increasing renewable energy supply make energy storage a critical technological component of the future energy landscape. research to build more reliable and cost-effective energy storage technologies is now on the rise. as a result, many new technologies and applications are evolving and competing. this paper presents a method to evaluate and select energy storage technologies for investor-owned or public utilities. for this purpose, energy storage applications which could benefit wind power in the pacific northwest region of the united states are identified through internal interviews and surveys with experts at the federal wholesale power marketing agency in portland, oregon. the study employs a technology evaluation process integrating fuzzy delphi method, analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy consistent matrix. the result shows that compressed air storage is the most promising technology for sustainable growth of renewable energy in the region.\",\"applying complex adaptive systems and risk society theory to understand energy transitions. renewable energy transitions are occurring across the globe in response to climate change. such socio-technical transitions are complex and non-linear. they require bold leadership and innovative policy, both in response to environmental risk and to navigate political, technical and socio-economic conditions. this paper integrates complex adaptive systems and risk society theory to inform a discussion on regional socio-technical transitions. south australia is forging its own adaptive pathway, and in doing so, is leading energy transitions in australia. utilising the complex adaptive cycle to frame the state's renewable energy transition, the path can be seen to be evolving from a simple first modernity to a multi-dimensional second modernity. socio-technical transitions are partly a by-product of responses to risk. while there is no single map for navigating societal transitions, this paper proposes that risk, in the context of risk society theory, is an important guiding dimension for understanding transformational change in socio-technical systems.\",\"uk natural gas system integration in the making, 1960-2010: complexity, transitional uncertainties and uncertain transitions. the article focuses on the development of the natural gas system in the uk from its establishment to the present day, as an analogue for the challenges of integrating large, infrastructural technical systems for a sustainability transition. it is inscribed within the multilevel perspective approach yet concentrates on 'system integration' as a complex and uncertain socio-technical process. the case study focuses on two interrelated transitions in order to provide a co-evolutionary and comprehensive understanding of the uncertainties in system development and integration faced by the uk natural gas industry. through thick historical analysis of the gas grid transition we provide insights into the sustainability of similar network technology transitions. at the same time we contribute to complex systems modelling approaches (broadly defined to include quantitative and qualitative modelling) by unravelling the roles and agencies of actors, institutions and technologies in the modelling and making of sustainability transitions.\",\"agency in transition: the role of transnational actors in the development of the off-grid solar pv regime in uganda. while the sustainability transitions literature has highlighted the importance of agency in technological change, there is still limited understanding of the role of transnational actors, such as development agencies, which tend to be key drivers of energy transitions in low-income countries. this paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the role of transnational actors in the development of off-grid solar pv regime in uganda, from the early 1980s to 2017. specifically, we develop a typology of transnational actors and examine their roles in mobilizing the flow of knowledge, capital and technology towards shaping the country's off-grid solar pv rural electrification regime. by discussing the pivotal role of foreign actors, their underlying motives and their shifting importance over time, the paper demonstrates empirically the highly transnational nature of regime development. in doing so, we contribute to the academic literature on actor-oriented determinants in sustainability transitions, as applied to low-income countries.\",\"leaders and followers in finance mobilization for renewable energy in germany and china. access to finance is a well-recognized barrier to scaling up renewable energy. using the case studies of germany and china, this research explores how governments spur renewable energy deployment by examining the availability, costs, and modes of financing. it compares the major financiers, their interactions, and government policy instruments, around renewable financing in both countries. the research concludes that finance mobilization should begin with actors who are willing to be patient and who are responsive to policies. finance is easier to mobilize when pre-existing and strong relationships between lenders and borrowers are leveraged. it concludes that a well-designed fiscal subsidy policy together with a national development bank aiming to level the playing field is the key to open the door for the participation of decentralized actors in germany, whereas a flawed fiscal subsidy policy and the pick-winner strategy of a national development bank advances big players in china.\",\"learning and diffusion of knowledge in clean energy communities. clean energy communities (cec) represent emerging socio-technical systems that offer a suitable alternative to non-sustainable energy production and consumption. thus, cecs cultivate new knowledge of clean energy use and diffuse it among their members as well as interested publics outside the cecs. this paper aims to contribute to the rather limited literature on the role of learning and knowledge in energy transitions in general and cecs\\u2019 knowledge circulation and learning in particular. the paper presents findings about the knowledge development and learning settings within cecs that provide the ways of cultivating knowledge within cecs and ways of disseminating this knowledge outside the cecs for potentially influencing wider social change. this research contributes to the energy transition literature by focusing on the overlooked perspective of learning and knowledge dissemination as an important part of a niche-innovation setting.\",\"redefining a stakeholder relation: finnish energy \\u201cprosumers\\u201d as co-producers. energy innovations have enabled micro-scale energy production that is challenging energy companies\\u2019 business models and operating environment. this article examines micro-producers of energy as energy \\u201cprosumers\\u201d\\u2014hybrid producers and consumers\\u2014and as a challenge to the current logic of energy companies\\u2019 stakeholder relations. the data consists of interviews and participant observations of finnish private solar panel owners and energy company representatives. the relationship between energy prosumers and the energy company is found to be a co-producing stakeholder relation that is issue-centric, not organization-centric. energy prosumers have heightened expectations of how they should be acknowledged by the energy company, particularly concerning reciprocity. the article clarifies the role of the energy prosumer as a new type of stakeholder and connects prosumer relations to the notion of co-production. thus, the article offers valuable information for energy companies when they update their business models to embrace prosumer relations and community involvement.\",\"actors in multi-sector transitions - discourse analysis on hydrogen in germany. with net-zero emission goals, low-carbon transitions enter a new phase of development, leading to new challenges for policymaking and research. multiple transitions unfold in parallel across different sectors. this involves a broad range of technologies, while actors engage in increasingly complex discourses. here, we study the discourses on hydrogen in germany. based on the analysis of 179 newspaper articles from 2016 to 2020, we find that a diverse set of actors, including many industry incumbents, speak favorably about hydrogen, emphasizing economic opportunities and its relevance for the energy transition, whereas skeptics highlight its low energy efficiency and expected scarcity. with the help of discourse network analysis, we identify three emerging conflicts around the use, production, and import of hydrogen. we explain these conflicts and the widespread support of incumbents with a conceptual framework that captures the complex interplay of sectoral contexts, specific technologies and actor interests.\",\"the barefoot college \\u2018eco-village\\u2019 approach to women's entrepreneurship in energy. there is a global call to address gender equality in energy, such as the united nations\\u2019 sustainable development goals 5 and 7. i discuss the case study of the solar mamas\\u2019 programme of the barefoot college in rural rajasthan that trains rural women in small-scale energy technology. the training, and engagement with the \\u2018eco-campus\\u2019 life particularly facilitated their \\u2018transformative\\u2019 empowerment while promoting entrepreneurship in energy technology. additionally, the solar programme supported the transition to clean energy technology in rural areas. these are new approaches in gender, energy and development, and women's empowerment literature, which can inform progressive and gender aware energy policies and programmes. nevertheless, a challenge is often the lack of a market in rural areas. issues also emerged regarding the design and affordability of the solar cookers.\",\"intermediacy and the diffusion of grassroots innovations: the case of cohousing in the united states.. grassroots innovations (gis) diffuse by three pathways: replication, up-scaling, and translation. to date, a small body of research illustrates that niche-to-regime translation occurs under conditions of intermediacy: when a niche shares some, but not all, properties of a regime it prefigures. there has been less focus on the dynamics of niche replication and up-scaling, and the conditions that encourage these diffusion pathways. drawing from interviews with the founders of cohousing initiatives in the united states, this paper offers in-depth accounts of replication and up-scaling, revealing how niche leaders and local project founders have positioned their projects as meaningful and practical to individuals with economic and social commitments to the mainstream. these results emphasize the interpretive nature of the diffusion of gis while also problematizing the concept of intermediacy. a more nuanced understanding of these niche diffusion pathways will inform subsequent research on gis, including additional subcategories of replication and up-scaling.\",\"governance of interactions between infrastructure sectors: the making of smart grids in the uk. this paper uses historical analysis to explore the evolution of interdependencies between the electricity and information and communication technology (ict) sectors in the uk. it explores the role of governance in shaping the interface between these two sectors, and subsequent implications for smart grid innovation. the analysis focuses on three periods between 1940 and 2016, with distinct institutional logics: state ownership, privatisation, and transitions to sustainability. the interactions between the electricity and ict sectors are analysed through raven and verbong\\u2019 (2007) typology: competition, symbiosis, integration and spill-over, drawing on social-technical transitions theories and discussed in terms of rules and institutions; actors and networks; and technology, artefacts and infrastructures of socio-technical regimes. the paper finds that a way to encourage more spill-overs and integration between the electricity and the ict sector is through a more symmetrical and integrated governance approach that takes into account the needs and characteristics of both sectors.\",\"understanding resistance to just transition ideas in australian coal communities. over the past several years, numerous actors across australian society have increasingly advocated \\u2018just transition\\u2019 policies to help coal communities move beyond their reliance on fossil fuel extraction. as part of this, individuals from the environmental movement, trade unions, various ngos and the private sector have called for a range of initiatives designed to help maintain the social and economic integrity of these regions as coal inevitably declines. yet while just transition ideas have grown in popularity in these numerous forums in australian society, it remains unclear how they are being understood by the very workers and communities for whom they are being proposed. to shed light on this question, we conducted interviews with residents of coal communities throughout eastern australia. we found that respondents had several key anxieties about just transition ideas and their impacts on their lives. in this paper, we break our findings down into five main themes that help explain these anxieties.\",\"influence of policy discourse networks on local energy transitions. policy actions at the local level are key to reaching national and global climate and energy transition goals. this study seeks to understand the factors that explain variation in energy transition success at the local level, meaning the progress that local regions make to advance renewable energies as well as energy efficiency measures. this is done through the study of discourses that characterize the local policy processes surrounding the german energy transition. discourses are conceptualized as infinite games, emphasizing the long-term and complex nature of transition processes. research questions examine how local-level energy transitions are influenced by the content and the structure of the discourse and rural versus urban characteristics. results from four regions show differences in discourse networks between rural and urban areas, as well as between more and less successful areas. implications for the design of policies that affect the energy transition at the local level are explored.\",\"framing low-carbon pathways: a discursive analysis of contending storylines surrounding the phase-out of coal-fired power in ontario. transition studies have made constructive efforts to attend more closely to the politics of sustainability transitions, with discourse emerging as an increasingly important means of interrogating these dynamics. drawing on discourse perspectives, this study deploys the multi-dimensional discursive approach to explore framing struggles surrounding a climate change mitigation experience of international significance (the phase-out of coal-fired power in ontario), revealing how ideas, interests, institutions, and infrastructure (the four i's of sustainable energy transitions) interact in constituting pathways to sustainability. this approach captures the way in which contending actors frame issues and technologies, modulating possibilities and shaping the sequences of choices that link current societal arrangements to future low-carbon states. the study elaborates how processes of negotiation among competing interests and priorities helped define the pathway to eliminate coal. it also suggests that regulatory measures may help to accelerate the pace of transitions and succeed where market approaches are politically untenable.\",\"modelling the macroeconomics of a \\u2018closing the green finance gap\\u2019 scenario for an energy transition. reaching the uk net-zero emissions target translates into substantial investment requirements into low-carbon energy infrastructure. however, investors are currently not investing sufficiently in renewable energy capacity, leading to the so-called green finance gap. current energy-economy models generally do not reveal the macroeconomic implications of policies aimed at scaling-up green finance for energy transitions. in the light of this background, we extend the energy-economy green investment barrier model with the insights from a systematic literature review to investigate the macroeconomic implications of a policy scenario designed to close the green finance gap in combination with and without a scenario to decarbonise the power sector. we also compare the achieved results with studies focusing on a similar research question. we find that the closing the green finance gap policy scenario alongside a low-carbon power scenario leads to the co-benefits of lower power system costs and unemployment, and increases in gdp.\",\"policy mixes across vertical levels of governance in the eu: the case of the sustainable energy transition in latvia. the european green deal requires policy alignment horizontally across policy areas but also vertically across governance levels. accordingly, the diversity of actors and their preferences can hinder sociotechnical transitions. we, therefore, ask: how do policy mixes unfold across vertical scales of governance in sociotechnical transitions? we analyse vertical policy mix characteristics, considering consistency, coherence, comprehensiveness, and credibility, and the inherent feedback loops between politics and policy. drawing on empirical evidence from latvia, gathered through content analysis and interviews with senior stakeholders, we highlight two key findings: first, friction points in policy coherence between the national-local governance levels feed back into the vertical policy mix, as eu-level policy strategies are not substantiated with corresponding policy instruments. second, the lack of political commitment to the transition at the national level perpetuates friction points in comprehensiveness and credibility of the vertical policy mix, hindering transition processes.\",\"capturing the distributional impacts of long-term low-carbon transitions. major policy proposals often require a distributional impact assessment, focusing on differential financial and other impacts across population segments. such assessments are rare, however, at the multi-decadal scale addressed in long-term (e.g. to 2050) low carbon transition modelling. there is therefore a risk of socially inequitable outcomes, which in turn presents a socio-political risk for decision-makers driving transitions. this paper uses a literature review and expert interviews to identify mechanisms by which low carbon transitions could differentially impact population sub-groups. as well as impacts of policy costs on bills, this includes factors such as ability to connect to heat networks or install onsite generation or storage. an approach to exploring distributional impacts across a range of long term scenarios from a united kingdom energy model (esme), is proposed. this sets out how bill changes and other costs associated with low carbon transition could impact different income quintiles in the uk.\",\"transnational linkages in sustainability experiments: a typology and the case of solar photovoltaic energy in india. this paper explores transnational linkages in sustainability experiments. transnational linkages refer to diverse cross-border relationships and interactions that can complement local, regional and national capabilities enabling sustainability experiments. the paper develops a typology of transnational linkages and applies it to solar photovoltaic energy initiatives in india. our analysis shows that transnational linkages appear to be almost universal in these experiments. of seven solar photovoltaic technology domains present in the sample, experiments in only one - off-grid power plants - can be characterised as predominantly domestic. these findings underscore the significance of capabilities, resources and linkages spanning local, regional and national scales in innovative solar pv experiments in india, suggesting similar patterns for other socio-technical experiments. this study contributes to an emerging literature on the geography of sustainable transitions, which argues for a move away from a predominantly national framing in transition studies to embrace a multi-scalar understanding of transition processes.\",\"neglecting exit doors: how does regret cost shape the irreversible execution of renewable energy megaprojects?. the energy transition process nowadays is characterized by the replacement of fossil fuels-based means of production with renewable energy (re). alongside the diffusion of decentralized re, this process is associated with the increased promotion of re megaprojects. such megaprojects, however, are often shaped by path-dependent lock-ins and thus continue to be promoted with limited changes despite the emergence of better alternatives along the way. this study explores the role of lock-ins in the irreversibility of re megaprojects while highlighting the notion of regret cost. in particular, the study sheds light on the influence of lock-ins within megaprojects, specifically focusing on their execution stage. using the establishment process of ashalim, a giant thermal solar power station in southern israel, as a case study, we demonstrate how various lock-ins increase regulators\\u2019 regret cost, thus escalating their commitment to the megaproject and causing them to neglect diverse \\u201cexit doors\\u201d during execution. we thus illuminate the irreversibility of re megaprojects and question their capability to meet the growing need of energy markets for flexibility.\",\"community participation in electricity markets: the impact of market organisation. energy communities are considered important drivers of the energy transition. while they have mainly focused on collective energy generation, they are increasingly getting involved in the provision and trading of energy and in flexibility services. this change of focus creates opportunities to participate in electricity markets but proves to be challenging because of the current electricity markets serving incumbency. in this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of how broader market organisation impacts participation of energy communities in electricity markets. drawing from transition studies and economic market literature, we develop a framework for analysing market organisation. based on a literature review, observations and semi-structured interviews with communities and market actors, we conclude that, as a result of conflicting community and market logic, communities often adjust their business models to participate in the markets, which could jeopardize their potential to contribute to radical system change.\",\"municipal utilities and electric cooperatives in the united states: interpretive frames, strategic actions, and place-specific transitions. renewable energy and social justice advocates are organizing around the potential for community-based democratic organizations to promote more decentralized, sustainable, and just societies. within this movement, consumer-owned electric utilities are often seen as central actors. yet, there has been little systematic investigation into why integration of distributed energy resources (ders) varies across these utilities. we explore this question using literature on sustainability transitions and strategic action fields. choices about when and how to integrate ders are shaped by new interpretations of long-standing principles, existing institutional relationships, and a utility's political power. we identify how four divergent strategies shape distinct technology configurations with differences in physical scale, concentration of political authority, and distribution of economic benefits. these differences suggest that local technology ownership may not be sufficient to motivate change in some contexts. policy addressing political processes and ownership scale may be needed to accelerate more sustainable and just energy transitions.\",\"recognising the second half of the oil age. technological developments saw radical progress over the past two centuries in the so-called industrial age, which made new demands for energy from coal and petroleum. but they are natural resources formed in the geological past which means they are subject to depletion. determining the current status of depletion is difficult, both because of unreliable reporting practices and definitions, and because the definition implicitly depends on the future state of technology, which cannot be known accurately. but the evidence available today suggests that the second half of the oil age is dawning. it will be characterised by dwindling supply, with rising costs, representing a turning point for mankind, but much can be done to react positively.\",\"policy instrument designed to gain transition legitimacy: a case of chinese nuclear development. nuclear energy development may encounter significant opposition if it is not deemed as legitimate by the general public even in an authoritarian state like china. this paper collects policy instruments designed in four nuclear stations in china, and reports both advantages as well as disadvantages of a centralised authority. at the central level, four types of policy tools are designed to win nuclear legitimacy. at local level, however, education and monitoring tools are well implemented with the help of highly centralised administrative system, while information disclosure and participation tools are only partially implemented since they need innovative reform of citizen deliberation and involvement mechanism. instead, local government and nuclear firms design various legitimacy-oriented policies such as institutionalizing nuclear into local culture and social life. however, there still lacks of effective policy design for long-term legitimacy winning in china that clearly defines the concept of \\u201cthe public\\u201d and \\u201clegitimacy\\u201d.\",\"communicating tensions among incumbents about system innovation in the dutch dairy sector. this article investigates the ways in which innovating incumbents address and deal with tensions in their daily conversations in a case of an dairy initiative aiming for sector transformation. analysis of meetings shows that innovating incumbents employ three strategies to address and deal with tensions such as concerns about the initiative's impact: voicing concerns, questioning as starting point and questioning as response. in these ways, they address tensions at the boundaries between representative and initiative and between representative and constituency. the assigned staff members of initiatives play a key role in opening up conversations on tensions. tensions among innovating incumbents are avoided in the formal meetings, but are addressed in the frequent bilateral contacts. the research adds to the understanding of the roles of incumbents in a \\u2018transformation pathway\\u2019, by showing how innovating incumbents in interaction question which actions contribute to a sector transformation.\",\"policy instruments for green-growth of clusters: implications from an agent-based model. green-growth theory asserts that green-innovations will allow us to decouple economic growth from pollution. policies that promote green-innovations are therefore paramount. scholarship has become increasingly interested in how green-clusters can contribute to sustainable innovation and decoupled green-growth. in this study, we create an agent-based model that can simulate a cluster's transition, as shaped by different policy instruments. we use this model to explore the effects of a) innovation grants, b) fines for pollution c) financial incentives for entrants, and d) an instrument mix of incentives and fines, on the green-growth of a peripheral-region cluster. our results indicate that designing instruments for absolutely decoupled growth of peripheral-clusters is close to impossible; and demonstrate the inherent trade-offs in designing policies for relatively decoupled growth. based on these results, we opine there should be more nuanced deliberation on the potential contribution of green-clusters to sustainable development,with greater focus on the possible trade-offs.\",\"risks and opportunities associated with decarbonising rotterdam's industrial cluster. the port of rotterdam is an important industrial cluster, comprising mainly oil refining, chemical production and power generation. in 2016, the port's industry accounted for 19% of the netherlands\\u2019 total co2 emissions. the port of rotterdam authority is aware that the cluster is heavily exposed to future decarbonisation policies, as most of its activities focus on trading, handling, converting and using fossil fuels. based on a study for the port authority using a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods, our article explores three pathways whereby the port's industry can maintain its strong position while significantly reducing its co2 emissions and related risks by 2050. the pathways differ in terms of the eu's assumed climate change mitigation ambitions and the key technological choices made by the cluster's companies. the focus of the paper is on identifying key risks associated with each scenario and ways in which these could be mitigated.\",\"modelling stakeholder agency to investigate sustainable charcoal markets in kenya. as cities in east africa keep growing, so too will demand for charcoal \\u2013 the region's preferred urban fuel \\u2013 placing increasing pressure on rural landscapes where it is produced. how can charcoal production and supply be made sustainable? what are the implications of sustainable charcoal policies and practices for achieving a low-carbon pathway and protecting the environment? this paper presents case study research focusing on kitui county, one of the main charcoal production areas in kenya. risk and uncertainty of sustainable charcoal policies in kitui were assessed using complementary methods of stakeholder workshops, informant interviews and agent-based modelling. this interdisciplinary approach combined policy research and simulation modelling, where local perspectives and data were included directly in the modelling. these methods facilitated critique of behaviour concerning agency and corruption. stakeholders valued the ability to access detailed information on micro-interactions and consider policy performance regarding both financial flows and biomass extraction.\",\"the afterlives of off-grid solar: the dynamics of repair and e-waste in malawi. there has been profound growth in the adoption of off-grid solar devices across sub-saharan africa over the last decade. however, there has been limited attention given to the afterlives of these devices and their justice implications. this is of particular concern as these increasing rates of off-grid solar adoption are across contexts in which regulatory mechanisms and e-waste infrastructure are weak or non-existent, leaving populations exposed to a range of social and ecological harms. in this paper, we examine upon research from malawi to draw attention to the spatial and ethical dimensions of off-grid solar repair and e-waste. we demonstrate how a two-tiered off-grid solar market, regional flows, and usage practice, result in ethically complex outcomes. we emphasize how strengthening the social and material infrastructures of repair, epitomised by the role of informal repair technicians, are vital to extending the productive lifespans of off-grid solar devices in comparable settings.\",\"comparing coal phase-out pathways: the united kingdom's and germany's diverging transitions. political decisions and trends regarding coal use for electricity generation developed differently in the uk and germany, despite being subject to relatively similar climate protection targets and general political and economic conditions. the uk agreed on a coal phase-out by 2024. in germany, a law schedules a coal phase-out by 2038 at the latest. this paper investigates reasons for the different developments and aims to identify main hurdles and drivers of coal phase-outs by using the triple embeddedness framework. the comparative case study approach reveals that policy outcomes regarding coal consumption are deeply influenced by several actor groups, namely, coal companies, unions, environmental ngos, and the government. the most discussed aspects of a coal phase-out in both countries are energy security concerns, whether coal is mined domestically, (regional) economic dependence, as well as the relative power of actors with vested interests in coal consumption.\",\"trajectories of sustainability transitions in scale-transcending innovation systems: the case of photovoltaics. this paper proposes that spatial dynamics of new environmental technologies can be better understood when positioned in a multi-scalar theoretical framework based on innovation system approaches. we combine territorial innovation system concepts with a technological innovation systems (tis) perspective. the investigation of photovoltaic (pv) technology in germany indicates that the relevance of different scales and actor constellations shifts in the course of a 'maturing' innovation system. first, the convergence of regional and institutional subsystems forms a temporary window of opportunity for a robust tis formation within a national framing. second, consolidation according to basic patterns of the underlying national innovation system takes place. this is illustrated by the robust performance of german mechanical pv equipment suppliers within a globalized pv value chain. the empirical findings allow for drafting a theoretical framework that offers a generalized view on this shifting spatial context pattern of an emerging environmental technology.\",\"sustainability that backfires: the case of biogas in emilia romagna. the development of a low carbon society does not always deliver sustainable outcomes at local level, as in the case of bioenergy. this paper analyses the impacts of biogas development in emilia romagna (italy) from a social, economic and environmental perspective (triple bottom line). since 2009, the number of biogas plants has exponentially increased here, following the introduction of the feed-in tariff. social opposition has been rising since. therefore, the goal of the study is to investigate the causal processes of biogas development in order to understand what endangered its triple bottom line sustainability. the study does so by employing qualitative system dynamics (i.e. causal loop diagram). results show that sustainability is threatened by weak local synergies, plants management and equipment deficiencies and agriculture related issues. the analysis suggests that policy interventions should focus on biomass supply and outputs diversification, governance, and social participation.\",\"no transition without transmission: hvdc electricity infrastructure as an enabler for renewable energy?. the sustained push for large-scale deployment of renewable energy technologies across the eu is generating transformation pressures on the transmission infrastructure and stimulating technological change within it. in particular, high voltage direct current (hvdc) technology has been rejuvenated in recent years and its role in the grid is now growing. still, uncertainties prevail over the longer-term extent of both sector transformation and hvdc development and diffusion. we analyze recent trends in hvdc as a technological innovation system (tis) within the transmission sector. we build on previous research that explicitly conceptualizes and analyzes interactions between a focal tis and other tis and larger sectors. our analysis illustrates the merits of such an approach. we conclude by pointing out key policy issues for changing transmission grids and for further hvdc development and diffusion. we also show how the idiosyncratic techno-economic properties of infrastructure sectors affect the dynamics of technological change within them.\",\"anchoring of innovations: assessing dutch efforts to harvest energy from glasshouses. in the multi-level perspective (mlp), two key levels are socio-technical regimes and technological niches. the linking processes between these levels, however, are not well understood. we use the concept of anchoring as a starting point towards a theory of linking and distinguish three forms: technological, network and institutional anchoring. our case study concerns attempts to reduce energy consumption in the dutch glasshouse horticulture sector, consisting of a variety of alternative energy approaches. distinguishing the three forms of anchoring appears to be useful for studying and understanding the interactions between novelty, niche and regime. the study reveals that 'hybrid actors' and 'hybrid forums' play a crucial role in bringing about various forms of anchoring. these findings are not only of analytical interest, but also relevant for practitioners who desire to induce system innovation to contribute to sustainability.\",\"a theory of ossification of energy services. this paper points out that energy efficiency has been an important driver of economic growth in the past but notes stagnation of efficiency in the electric power sector since 1960. the \\\"ossification\\\" of electric industry efficiency gains trace in part to the industry's exemption from the anti-trust laws, but also to the unfortunate formulation of pollution regulations. these allows plants to operate forever at whatever emissions were allowed when the plant was built, but force a plant that improves its conversion efficiency to meet latest rules. this severely penalizes the owners of electricity generation plants who would otherwise gain from investments in greater efficiency and in the process cut emissions, by requiring immediate reduction of all \\\"criteria\\\" pollutants to current best available control levels. the added cost of this essentially eliminates any economic incentive to improve efficiency. the paper lists steps that could change this situation and \\\"de-ossify\\\" the industry.\",\"historical transitions of western australia's electricity system, 1880-2016. we present a historical analysis of the evolution of southern western australia's electricity system between the 1880\\u2032s and 2016. by applying a multi-level perspective (mlp), we identify historic actions that impact the system's ability to successfully transition towards higher rates of distributed energy. the adopted methodology seeks to address geographic and temporal weaknesses in the mlp approach. we found that the system is at a definitive branching point between a de/re-alignment (radical change) or reconfiguration (incremental change) pathway as up to 50% of the network's energy requirement comes from distributed energy. political and policy decision-making inertia at local, national and international levels increases the chances of returning to a decentralized electricity system reminiscent of those in place during the early 1900\\u2032s. the management of the transition in this small islanded system can provide lessons for larger systems that are yet to experience significant impacts from distributed energy.\",\"how the european recovery program (erp) drove france's petroleum dependency, 1948\\u20131975. the article investigates the roles of the european recovery program (erp) and the organization for european economic co-operation (oeec) in pushing france towards a pathway of petroleum dependency. the study is based on the energy transition and the deep transition frameworks, notably the analysis of specific collective actors. the analysis elaborates on the impact the oeec refinery expansion program had on (a) quality and quantity of petroleum product supply in france; (b) the french position within global crude oil and petroleum product trade; (c) the technological interrelatedness of the petroleum sector with agriculture, transport, and mobility. we show how different measures were designed to integrate sociotechnical systems, accelerate the transformation of energy systems and put the objective of western europe's \\u201chidden integration\\u201d to work. the article concludes that complementing transition studies with historical and socio-metabolic perspectives can shed light on the origins of unsustainable pathways during the 20th century.\",\"sustainability transition and economic growth enigma: money or energy?. the complex relationship between economic growth, job creation, peak oil and climate change is discussed. this starts from seven facts and leads to five propositions to deal with the consequences of these facts. the overall message is that global economic policy should be redirected, that we need a better understanding of the reasons for the current economic malaise, that \\\"peak oil\\\" remains a concern (despite shale \\\"fracking\\\"), and that climate change is a relevant economic issue demanding a serious response. there is probably only one strategy that has a chance of reversing the present \\\"death spiral\\\" of the global economy and simultaneously reducing the risk of catastrophic climate change. that path requires major investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in the near and medium term. the investments must be attractive to long-run (20-30 year) investors (pension funds, insurance companies) and probably take the form of securitized, resource-based bonds.\",\"the politics and economics of constructing, contesting and restricting socio-political space for renewables - the german renewable energy act. this paper addresses the politics and economics of constructing, contesting and reducing the \\\"socio-political space\\\" for renewables connected to the german renewable energy act (eeg). the political discourse is traced, revealing a gulf between \\\"fit and conform\\\" versus \\\"stretch and transform\\\" narratives. the former focus on short-term consumer costs, short learning periods and cost reductions from r&d rather than from market formation. the latter focus on total costs and acknowledge the need for lengthy learning periods and market formation to reduce costs. the version of the \\\"fit and conform\\\" narrative which recently became dominant, misrepresents the eeg surcharge, exaggerates the \\\"burden\\\" by ignoring external costs of fossil generation and doesn't consider inter-generational equity issues. this reflects the defensive reactions of a politically entrenched industry caught in a process of creative destruction, appealing to political actors such as the european commission by invoking europe's industrial competitiveness and (ideologically shared) technology-neutral policies.\",\"deployment of co2 capture and storage in europe under limited public acceptance\\u2014an energy system perspective. in this paper we analyse how in europe large-scale deployment of co2 capture and storage (ccs) technology may be hindered by limited public acceptance. we develop scenarios for how public acceptance may constrain the diffusion of ccs, either by reducing the overall amount of installable ccs capacity or by delaying its introduction, and show with an integrated assessment model how the type of limitation in ccs acceptance can critically impact the development of all sectors in the overall energy system over time. we also demonstrate that a reduction or delay in ccs diffusion as a result of critical public opinion can have substantial energy system impacts that differ across not only the nature of acceptance profile but also the sector(s) in which limited public acceptance materializes. applying a constraint to ccs deployment in both industry and the power sector simultaneously leads to an energy system that is fundamentally different from the one that emerges if the constraint is only applied to the power sector. depending on how and where ccs diffusion is constrained, net additional annual energy system costs in 2050 can vary between -50 billion up to nearly 800 billon $/yr.\",\"boosting resource productivity: creating ping-pong dynamics between resource productivity and resource prices. this paper briefly reviews the economic literature on resource scarcity, resource availability and economic growth. the club of rome study \\\"limits to growth\\\" was given short shrift by economists because it contradicted historical evidence that resource prices have been declining, not increasing, since the industrial revolution thanks to technological progress in exploration, mining and refining of metals and fossil fuels. recent events, however, suggest that resource prices are no longer declining, either because of increasing demand by developing countries (e.g. china) or because of limits to technological progress - or for other reasons. in any case, this situation suggests that resource productivity is far too low, today, and needs to be boosted sharply. this can be done by cutting subsidies and shifting taxes away from labor and capital onto resource extraction and consumption, thus promoting technological innovation in resource efficiency.\",\"starting low, reaching high? sequencing in eu climate and energy policies. in order to achieve the unfccc paris agreement goals, climate policies worldwide require considerable ratcheting-up. policy sequencing provides a framework for analysing policy process dynamics that facilitate ratcheting-up. we apply a sequencing perspective to two key eu climate and energy policies, the emissions trading scheme (ets) and the renewable energy directive (red), to comparatively test the empirical relevance of sequencing for single policies \\u2013 in addition to sequencing across policies, which has been the focus of sequencing theory so far \\u2013 and to uncover specific mechanisms. our results confirm that sequencing, based on triggering positive and controlling negative feedback, is relevant both within and across policies. policy choices that may facilitate ratcheting-up include tools to control costs, the possibility to centralise and harmonise in a multi-level governance context, options for compensation of reluctant actors, and the encouragement of learning processes.\",\"explaining inclusivity in energy transitions: local and community energy in aotearoa new zealand. international literature on citizen, local and community energy (lce) has grown exponentially but has focussed on european and north american context. this paper contributes to understanding inclusivity in country-specific energy transition pathways, setting out an empirical analysis of grassroots energy innovation practices in a country that has to date followed an incumbent-led energy transition pathway \\u2013 aotearoa (new zealand). a groundswell of emerging lce initiatives face protracted feasibility stages and high failure rates, primarily due to lack of market access and risk exposure, and a lack of policy co-ordination and streamlining, with no popularised articulation of a collective energy transition strategy as such. barring changes in discourse, regulation, and institutional arrangements, future lce development is likely to be oriented primarily to accommodate utility-scale renewable energy through energy efficiency and demand side management. within this unsupportive regime context however, we observe uniquely resourced forms of lce, and identify strategies and policies for a more inclusive pathway. our findings reveal the limits of grassroots agency and the dependence of wider diffusion of lce on an enabling institutional context, suggesting there are understudied transition pathways in which opportunities for lce are relatively constrained.\",\"china's post-covid-19 stimulus: no green new deal in sight. much hope has been placed on china's decisions regarding low-carbon stimulus following covid-19. analysis of china's recent government work report suggests that while a repeat of recovery measures focused on high-emissions infrastructure following the 2008 global recession is not in the cards, a chinese green new deal is not in sight either. much investment is flowing to fossil fuel industries, whilst support policies for renewable energy industries are absent from beijing's recovery program. these signs of environmental ambition taking a back seat are worrisome given that beijing is currently designing its 14th five-year plan.\",\"technology diffusion and green transition support in the brick sector of bangladesh: why transformational change is still elusive. the government of bangladesh keeps using the policy instrument of technology mandate to achieve technology substitution in the brick industry. the target of achieving 100% technology substitution by 2013 is yet to be achieved. using historical data this paper models diffusion trajectory of the substitute technologies and found that 100% substitution is unlikely by 2035 although the action is prioritized in the updated nationally determined contribution (ndc). several development agencies have implemented projects aimed at cleaner technology diffusion in the sector over the last twenty years. using established definitions of functions from innovation system literature, actions of all development partners in the sector were mapped against the functions. donor projects were found to be more involved under guidance of search and creation of legitimacy functions. the implications of this research can inform design of future donor supported projects piloting climate technologies with insights from diffusion theories and innovation system.\",\"lessons from bali for small-scale biogas development in indonesia. being dependent on fossil fuels, indonesia faces challenges in incorporating renewables into its energy supply, which hampers to achieve the ndc target of 26% emission reduction. we investigate how biogas could contribute to a low-carbon transition pathway as cooking fuel, especially through the national mid-term development planning. using mixed-methods and stakeholder engagement, we conducted transdisciplinary research to advance knowledge on biogas in indonesia. we used q-methodology to explore the ambiguity around biogas developments leading us to identify three \\u201cperspectives\\u201d regarding value on biogas: technology, co-benefits, and independence. quantitative research using the e3me model identified economic benefits of biogas, but also an increase in lpg use due to unstable feedstock availability (hence intermittent biogas production), which could cause a potential increase of national co2 emissions. those and other barriers including ill-adapted technology to local conditions and barriers to financing installations require sound policies to be overcome, focusing on co-benefits of biogas.\",\"managing the transition to sustainability in an emerging economy: evaluating green growth policies in indonesia. rapidly growing emerging economies, such as brazil, china, india and indonesia have joined the ranks of major industrialized countries as significant emitters of greenhouse (ghg). their rapid economic growth has, however, brought about considerable environmental degradation, health costs, material damage, and a decrease in agriculture productivity. the notion of \\\"green growth\\\" has been proposed as a way out. this paper examines the case of indonesia and evaluates its search for green growth through an approach that combines a so-called energy mix policy and a redd+ program.\",\"towards a more resource-efficient solar future in the eu: an actor-centered approach. material constraints may slow the pace of energy transition if the materials intensity of renewable energy technologies remains the same. innovations in solar photovoltaics (pv) can contribute to achieving lower material demands. in this research, the actor-centered institutionalism framework, transitions literature and the science-policy interface framework are used to analyze how the involved actors perceive the transition towards more resource-efficiency in solar pv, what their preferences are, and how government should support this transition. altogether, resource-efficiency is not sufficiently supported, while it is considered extremely important in the future of solar pv according to various involved actors. traditional silicon-based solar panels are locked-in into the current policy landscape. actors prioritizing resource-efficiency interact in a niche space, while actors involved in traditional silicon-based pv form the regime. improved alignment between science and policy actors would help ease disagreements and prevent or benefit from path-dependency, thus, supporting resource-efficiency in solar pv.\",\"regional capacity to govern the energy transition: the case of two dutch energy regions. in this paper we analyse how interactions between governing bodies influence dutch energy regions\\u2019 capacity to govern the energy transition. we develop an analytical framework which draws on, and merges, two different theoretical perspectives: multi-level governance and capacities for transformative climate governance. we apply this framework in an exploratory case study of the dutch energy regions holland rijnland and noordoost brabant. results are primarily derived using a set of interviews and desk study. aided by the framework, we find that, while the regional energy strategy (res) arrangement is clearly geared towards facilitating orchestration through coordination and exchange of ideas and standpoints, the current governance approach, is hindered by unclear and ambiguous roles and responsibilities, a referral back to and dependence on traditional hierarchical structures, and high transaction costs. these interactions negatively influence capacity development in the regional energy transition by complicating strategic alignment and the creation of opportunity contexts.\",\"too risky \\u2013 the role of finance as a driver of sustainability transitions. the finance sector has a long track record of engaging with sustainability issues, and policymakers and sector representatives agree that a transition to sustainability needs to be mirrored by rapidly expanding financing. based on in-depth interviews with a broad range of actors in the swedish finance sector, we show that despite a strong recognition of the challenges, the sector remains cautious towards risk. we explore what motivates the sector and how to govern a faster transition and find that informants strongly believe that the sector cannot move any faster without further government intervention. the preferred policy is the use of generic tools such as co2 taxes, or for the government to step in and mitigate the risk. we conclude that a more ambitious narrative on how the private and public sector can collaborate to share risk is needed, as it is unlikely that the finance sector will lead the way.\",\"incorporating social mechanisms in energy decarbonisation modelling. the achievement of national pledges that are compatible with the paris agreements warming limit of 1.5c is a massive challenge, as it requires not only an acceleration of technological innovation, but also a socio-economic and cultural transformation. reducing uncertainties demands a better integration of behavioural evolutions in models exploring future energy pathways, including non-monetary barriers and drivers to technology diffusion. this study provides suggestions on incorporating social mechanisms of change such as resistance to change and the diffusion of environmental values into a uk-focused probabilistic energy system model, with a focus on people's attitudes towards residential heating technologies. we also offer a comprehensive literature review on interdisciplinary energy transitions modelling and exploratory scenarios embedding climate risks perceptions. we argue that efficient policy-making to meeting net-zero emissions targets must fully embrace whole-system approaches, support the more constrained segments of society, and account for interconnected socio-political factors.\",\"the space, the time, and the money. wind energy politics in east germany. the transition to renewable energy generates significant conflicts over time when technical innovations allowing larger wind turbine construction coincides with spatial regimentation as energy governance. the interplay of space, time and money, we argue, is crucial for understanding these conflicts. wind energy's spatial advantage of potential social co-existence of energy generation and farming gets eaten up by differently constituted chronoscapes and regional planning, resulting in local perception of renewable energy as a threat and encroachment and experts working against a renewable energy transition. drawing on the example of brandenburg in east germany, we demonstrate that financial means is next to space and time the third utmost relevant factor for local attitudes towards renewable energy.\",\"why did more sustainable cements failed so far? disruptive innovations and their barriers in a basic industry. the development of more sustainable cements is a challenging but urgent venture. demand-oriented knowledge formation and the reliance on existing prescriptive standards impede progress towards more sustainable alternatives to conventional cements. none-the-less the last years saw the emergence of a number of technology based start-ups with ambitions to introduce new low-carbon cements as alternatives to traditional ordinary portland cement (opc). an overall analysis of the technological innovation system for cement technology is conducted. this is extended with an investigation of how three start-ups, celitement, novacem and calera perform within this environment. the implementation of new materials requires new types of collaboration between r&d and market actors, a combination of synthetic with the existing analytic knowledge base and redefinition of standards and norms. moreover, a close cooperation of incumbent actors along the construction value chain is precondition for success of disruptive innovations.\",\"understanding the correlation between energy transition and urbanization. renewable energy and energy efficiency are recognized among the key factors of transitioning towards a low-consumption and low-carbon society. in order to achieve such transition, the government policies should be aimed at meeting the renewable energy generation and energy efficiency targets of specific localities. nonetheless, these targets vary between different urban regions, and there is limited knowledge on the correlation between energy transition and urbanization levels. the aim of this paper is to identify that correlation in urban regions. this study places italian regions under the microscope of an empirical investigation. the study adopts a two-step analysis that provides a useful model for regional analyses. the results of the study consolidates our understanding and highlights that the energy transition process requires greater efforts concerning social participation and provision of incentives for renewable energy production, mainly in the less urbanized areas.\",\"power and empowerment of grassroots innovations for sustainability transitions: a review. the sustainability transitions scholarship is increasingly applying power and empowerment frameworks to investigate the role of grassroots innovations in the politics of societal change; however, theoretical fragmentation persists. this paper presents a systematic literature review of 88 studies on grassroots innovations for sustainability transitions that employ the lenses of power and empowerment. we take stock of the conceptual development of power and empowerment in the grassroots innovations literature and propose directions for future research to stimulate further theorisation of these terms. our study shows that grassroots innovation scholars reproduce an epistemic bias towards power and empowerment as strategic exercises, thereby inhibiting our understanding of the range of forms of power and empowerment manifested in and through grassroots innovations and how these forms shape innovators\\u2019 struggles and achievements to leverage societal change. we call for a richer theorisation of power and empowerment of grassroots innovations beyond strategic conceptualisations of these terms.\",\"renewable electricity policy in asia: a qualitative comparative analysis of factors affecting sustainability transitions. a qualitative comparative analysis was undertaken of 18 asian countries to determine factors that influence the pace of their sustainability transitions toward increased renewable energy for electricity. we develop a policy index based on renewable electricity targets, feed-in tariffs, and emissions trading schemes in these countries. countries with a relatively low level of current renewable electricity generation but with relatively high scores on the policy index are wealthier and more democratic. likewise, countries with a relatively high level of renewable electricity generation and with lagging renewable electricity policy tend to be poorer, more authoritarian, and endowed with higher levels of fossil-fuel resources. thus, our analysis points to factors other than gdp per capita that could explain the relative stasis or progress of a country toward a sustainable energy transition. implications for the literature on the political and societal (or \\\"landscape\\\") dimensions of sustainability transitions are discussed.\",\"limits of the corporate-led market approach to off-grid energy access: a review. markets not only enable wide technology diffusion but also shape sustainability transitions. from this perspective, it is critical to investigate the shaping effects of markets and market formation processes for human wellbeing and the environment. through a systematic literature review, this study explores the limitations of the dominant corporate-led market development model. this constitutes the global compass for present-day energy access programs and international development policy, framed around the potential of foreign-affiliated corporate enterprises for the market-based diffusion of solar products in the global south. findings suggest that due to tradeoffs between people, planet, and profit-directed goals, the companies cannot enable sustainability transitions and equal and sustainable access to the energy poor. instead, the corporate-led market development route reproduces structural injustices. a more pluralistic route with greater roles for local, non-affiliated entrepreneurs, non-profits, and the public sector is proposed for negotiating the tradeoffs to the extent possible.\",\"the first world war and the latin american transition from coal to petroleum. while it is true that the precise nature of the future energy transition is uncertain, and no standardized transition is expected as such, it is also true that the energy transition phenomenon can only be described as an historical phenomenon. the latin american early adoption of petroleum as principal energy source during the first quarter of the 20th century challenged the universality of the energy transition observed for the advanced economies and the associated features regarding pace, irreversibility and the sequence within the energy transition. this paper deepens on the analysis of this episode marked by the disruptions created by first world war to show how economic, geographical and political aspects defined the shape and pace of the early switch to oil of the latin american republics. the aim is to develop a more nuanced understanding of socio-spatial contexts, scale, and the global\\u2013local relationships that constitute core elements of socio-technical systems.\",\"steering the \\u2018c-day\\u2019: insights from the rapid, planned transition of the uk's natural gas conversion programme. the article studies the steering strategies pursued during a major sociotechnical transition in the then state-owned british gas industry. we focus on the ten-year (1967\\u20131977) national project to convert 35 million appliances to run on natural gas instead of manufactured gas. the article: a. addresses the issue of steering in the multi-faceted, complex process of conversion and identifies the context of and challenges faced by the natural gas conversion programme in the 1960s and how actors responded and coordinated action; b. identifies modes of steering followed by key actors and institutions of the period; c. identifies essential precursors for this successful steering, including: the recognition of the challenges the industry faced in the pre-transition years; an openness to experimentation, r&d and organizational and technical change; and harmonious relations with government. we argue that the steering approach needs to combine an emphasis on planning and institutional and regulatory innovation with aspects of the mundane governance approach. our analysis shows, with reference to the uk's low-carbon gas transition, that while rapid, planned transitions are achievable, they may require complex, demanding forms of steering and governance that may prove hard to achieve in today's socioeconomic and political conditions.\",\"framing branching points for transition: policy and pathways for uk heat decarbonisation. this paper develops the use of the branching point concept as a tool to support key decisions for reorienting systems for sustainability. in this approach, a pathway is seen as arising from accumulation of many specific decisions which create momentum in a particular direction and so reinforce the irreversibility of the pathway. three complementary approaches to branching point analysis are identified within the transitions literature: 1) in pathway-scenarios for sustainability, 2) framing key decision-points in historical analysis, 3) to deconstruct the politics of transition pathways. a case study of uk heat decarbonisation is used to apply the branching point concept. this analysis highlights the tension where a policy approach, framed by a sector-wide target, interacts with distinct socio-technical responses and an alternative policy approach to decision-points is proposed. this paper demonstrates the potential to develop branching point analysis into a tool to support and help structure policy decisions for transition.\",\"the impact of the financial-economic crisis on sustainability transitions: financial investment, governance and public discourse. the paper distinguishes four views on the impact of the financial-economic crisis on sustainability transitions (operationalized as diffusion of green niche-innovations). the first three views highlight the possibility of positive impacts of the financial-economic crisis on sustainability transitions and joint solutions: (a) a comprehensive transformation of the capitalist system, (b) a green industrial revolution, linked to a sixth green kondratieff wave, and (c) green growth. the fourth view perceives the impact as mainly negative, because the financial-economic crisis weakens public, political and business attention for environmental problems. the paper confronts these views with secondary data on three analytical categories: (1) financial investment, (2) policy and governance, and (3) public opinion and civil society. data focus on renewable energy and climate policy in the uk, europe and the world. the paper concludes that the early crisis years (2008-2010) created a window of opportunity for positive solutions. but since 2010-2011 this window appears to be shrinking, with the financial-economic crisis having negative influences on sustainability transitions that may cause some slow-down.\",\"new business models for a radical change in resource efficiency. beginning with an analysis of the business constraints imposed by increasingly scarce resources, in this paper i make the case for a 'circular economy'. the principles of this approach are outlined, as is the need for new business models. i also discuss incentives to stimulate enterprises to enter the circular economy.\",\"innovation system analyses and sustainability transitions: contributions and suggestions for research. this paper argues (1) that technology-specific policies are necessary if we are to meet the climate challenge and (2) that a main contribution of innovation system (is) analysis to the study of sustainability transitions is that it allows policy makers to identify the processes and components in a system where intervention is likely to matter most. we demonstrate that an is framework can identify a diverse set of system weaknesses in the field of environmental innovation and identify five venues for further research that can help strengthen the framework and improve its application to environmental innovations.\",\"transnational linkages and sustainable transitions in emerging countries: exploring the role of donor interventions in niche development. recent studies have found that further development of the mlp is needed to conceptualise and empirically assess the role of transnational linkages in niche development. this paper explores the factors that may explain the effect of twenty years of donor interventions as one form of transnational linkage in promoting the development of a palm oil biomass waste-to-energy niche in malaysia. the paper contributes to the existing literature by a conceptual and empirical examination of this research question. with regard to its empirical findings the paper concludes: (i) that advice on energy policy had a limited impact mainly due to strong opposing interests in maintaining the existing situation; (ii) that creating the necessary conditions for transferring a private-sector model of electricity production to malaysia remains a challenge; and (iii) that the short duration and unpredictability of interventions generally can be seen as an important impediment for programs in reaching their objectives.\",\"what interests do intermediaries prioritize during wind- and solar project development?. a transition towards a low-carbon energy system requires the large-scale diffusion of renewable electricity (re) technologies. intermediary actors, such as installers, project developers or consultants, can facilitate this process by supporting re adopters. recent studies have also pointed out that there are potential drawbacks associated with intermediary support. acting as filters and gatekeepers, intermediaries have the complex mission to prioritize between various stakeholder interests, including their own profit maximization. the aim of this research is to understand what stakeholder interests intermediaries prioritize when developing re projects. results of a choice experiment with third-party developers in sweden highlight differences between technologies: wind developers prioritize electricity output, while solar developers prioritize client satisfaction. despite being for-profit organizations, intermediaries did not prioritize their own interests over the interests of their clients. solar pv developers prioritize client satisfaction over maximization of electricity output, which may have negative implications for the efficiency of the projects.\",\"trust gaps in energy transitions: japan's national deliberative poll after fukushima. a global decline in public trust has created a strong need for governments worldwide to engage citizens in order to enhance policy legitimacy and ensure effective post-fukushima energy transitions. deliberative policy-making \\u2013 an advanced form of participatory policy-making that emphasises dialogue and debate \\u2013 is widely regarded as an intervention that can enhance trust and subsequently legitimacy of energy transitions policies. however, the potential and limits of deliberative policy-making remain the subject of debate. this paper contributes to this debate by exploring deliberative policy-making from a trust perspective. we develop a trust-based systems framework of deliberative policy-making in the energy transitions context to understand, examine, and conceptualise the quality of such policy-making processes. our framework is tested and applied to a case study of a national deliberative poll (dp) on energy held in japan in 2012. this study draws on qualitative and quantitative data derived from the dp, in particular from a two-day deliberative forum involving 285 citizens. the findings indicate that the existence of a trust gap may jeopardise the quality of deliberative processes where citizen participation is considered as an input and enhanced policy legitimacy as an output of a policy-making system. we also show that the trust gap is a complicated concept consisting of three dimensions (trust in information, motives, and competence) and three types of directional dynamics (vertical, horizontal, and temporal). our study identifies the context of public distrust as well as the broader political environment as two critical contextual conditions that may inhibit the closure of the trust gap. our study contains rich insights on deliberative policy-making in the energy context, arguing that it carries no guarantee of enhanced policy legitimacy. policy-makers in the energy transitions field need to focus attention on creating the conditions to build public trust in order to enhance policy legitimacy and thus realise the potential benefits of deliberative practices of policy-making.\",\"a discourse analysis of yellow-vest resistance against carbon taxes. carbon taxation is a core instrument for climate mitigation. its implementation, however, faces popular resistance. in this paper we study one of the most emblematic mobilizations triggered by the carbon tax issue, the yellow vest movement in france. we use q-methodology, a mixed-method approach to identify discourses (or viewpoints) held by protesters. we find four statistically-distinctive viewpoints, emphasizing respectively: a systemic critique of capitalism; environmental action that is fair; priority over incomes and purchasing power of common people; and inequality and the responsibilities of corporations. our research points to the importance of ideology in shaping viewpoints and filtering attitudes towards carbon taxes. yet beyond ideological differences, we find consensus among all discourses, in that there should be more consultation in energy transition policy; the rich and not the poor should pay the cost of transition; and the government should use tax revenue for the transition only. we conclude that, for bold carbon tax schemes to be implemented with less conflict, a much more participatory, transparent and equitable design would be necessary than the one experienced in france.\",\"do lead markets for clean coal technology follow market demand? a case study for china, germany, japan and the us. despite high co2 emissions released by coal-fired energy production, coal will remain an important source of energy in coming decades. this case study explores the lead market status of china, germany, japan and the us for clean coal technologies. we concentrate on two existing technological standards: supercritical (sc) and ultra-supercritical (usc) pulverized coal technologies. in 1960s and 1970s, the us was a lead market for sc und usc technologies. during these decades, japan was a lag market, but it surpassed the us in the early 1980s. recently price and demand advantages began to shift to china. we conclude that lead market status may switch over time to markets with high growth rates, although first mover advantages may exist in non-lead markets for some r&amp;d-intensive products, such as turbines. less r&amp;d-intensive products, such as boilers, are attractive as a basis for leapfrogging strategies, which many emerging countries have been successfully employing.\",\"macroeconomics, financial crisis and the environment: strategies for a sustainability transition. we raise fundamental questions about macroeconomics relevant to escaping the financial-economic crisis and shifting to a sustainable economy. first, the feasibility of decoupling environmental pressure from aggregate income is considered. decoupling as a single environmental strategy is found to be very risky. next, three main arguments for economic growth are examined: growth as progress, growth to avoid economic instability, and growth to offset unemployment due to labor productivity improvements. for each, we offer orthodox, heterodox and new responses. attention is paid to progress indicators, feedback mechanisms affecting business cycles, and strategies to limit unemployment without the need for growth. besides offering an economy-wide angle, we discuss the role of housing and mortgage markets in economic cyclicality. finally, interactions between real economic and financial-monetary spheres are studied. this includes money creation, capital allocation and trade-offs between efficiency and operating costs of financial systems. throughout, environmental and transition implications are outlined.\",\"district heating in the uk: a technological innovation systems analysis. district heating infrastructure could contribute to the uk's energy policy goals of decarbonisation, renewable energy deployment, tackling fuel poverty and ensuring energy security. however, while a number of schemes have been developed over the last decade, deployment of the technology remains limited. this paper adopts a technological innovation systems framework to ask what the principal challenges are to significantly scaling up the deployment of dh in the uk. while district heating networks are inherently local infrastructures, they are positioned in regulatory and market contexts organised at larger spatial scales, making geography an important factor and coordination across spatial scales an important policy area for accelerated deployment.\",\"the sun also rises in norway: solar scientists as transition actors. this study contributes to transition studies through an empirical analysis of scientists at the norwegian research center for solar cell technology. from a policy perspective, this research centre is a concrete undertaking within transitions politics. how do solar energy scientists make sense of this mission and what strategies do they adopt? the analysis adopts a bottom-up perspective focusing on the politics involved in actor-networks constructing and empowering sustainable innovations. i suggest the micro/macro-divide characterising transition studies may be discarded, if we recognise that actors operate both on niche, regime, and landscape level. instead of presuming a multi-level perspective, transition studies could analyse the multi-actor politics of translations in arenas of development. adopting this approach, i argue that solar scientists pursue mainly two lines of activities: improving efficiency (translations to fit and conform) and challenging negative hegemonic representations of solar energy (translations to stretch and transform).\",\"a struggle for change\\u2014the formation of a green-transition advocacy coalition in finland. finland aims to increase the share of renewable energy to over 50% of all energy consumption by 2030. even more ambitious visions exist of a 100% renewable energy system by 2050. to spur the process, campaigns promoting renewable energy and a new association have been established, creating a new energy political advocacy coalition in finland. this article studies the green-transition advocacy coalition's formation in the field of finnish energy policy. the article identifies coalition actors\\u2019 core beliefs, and analyzes the coalition's impact on policy change. the coalition has certain values in common, but is nevertheless divided by different views. the green-transition coalition in finland could potentially be an important change agent but its impact is weakened due to divergent views in relation to the actual energy transition.\",\"integrated assessment of renewable energy potential: approach and application in rural south africa. this paper presents the development and application of the integrated renewable energy potential assessment (irepa), employing a three-pronged approach: (i) literature review of renewable energy potential assessment methodologies, renewable energy technology (ret) selection factors and impact assessment methods; (ii) discussions with academic peers from natural and social sciences, and the private energy engineering sector; (iii) evaluation of the irepa methodology through case-study research in a rural community in south africa. locally relevant social, institutional, environmental and techno-economic factors were explored through mutual knowledge exchange with smallholders and subsequently applied for appropriate ret selection. three barriers to participatory decision-making were revealed: i) lack of knowledge ofrenewable energy among smallholders; ii) insufficient practical information dissemination in irepa; iii) abstract nature of the analytical hierarchy process. the adaptions recommended by this research would render irepa a suitable bottom-up approach for the assessment and effective implementation of ret, stimulating socio-economic development in rural areas.\",\"people's perceptions of energy technologies in an era of rapid transformation. in this article, we draw on theorizing about how people navigate risk and uncertainty in contemporary times to explain public perceptions of a range of energy technologies. in doing so, we critique existing literature that has focused on the concepts nimby (\\u2018not in my backyard\\u2019) and technological acceptance. we use data collected from canada to examine people's comfort levels with energy technologies generally as well as within proximity to their homes. drawing on surveys with residents of the provinces of british columbia and new brunswick, we asked participants about their comfort levels with energy technologies related to coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear, hydro-electric dams, wind, and solar. we utilize our findings to provide a more nuanced understanding of why people are less comfortable with energy technologies being placed in close proximity to their homes in comparison to their comfort levels with these technologies more generally. we demonstrate that enhancing understandings of how people grapple with risk and uncertainty related to energy technologies can aid in our transition to a less carbon-intensive energy future.\",\"governed by tensions: the introduction of renewable energies and their integration in the bulgarian energy system (2006\\u20132016). this paper examines the establishing a low-carbon electricity system through the introduction of renewable energies in bulgaria \\u2013 an eu member and a former socialist state undergoing a vast socio-economic transformation over the last 29 years. thus, the current introduction of re is ambivalent. on the one hand, in just five years, a total of more than 1700 mw of new wind and photovoltaic plants were installed - almost as much as the country's nuclear capacity (2000 mw). on the other hand, after 2012, the re development was stopped by means of several legislative amendments. thus, governed by tensions, and recently experiencing a financial crisis in the energy sector, unintended new opportunities for re occurred abroad. this could be a chance for \\u201cleapfrogging\\u201d pathway to low-carbon transition. though a challenge still remain in the \\u201cstate capture\\u201d processes in the bulgarian politics.\",\"macroeconomics of sustainability transitions: second-best climate policy, green paradox, and renewables subsidies. a steeply rising carbon tax is the best way to stimulate the early switch from fossil fuel to renewables. if such a tax is infeasible and a subsidy on renewables is used instead, fossil fuel is pumped more vigorously and global warming exacerbated. however, this green paradox does not hold if it is not optimal to fully exhaust fossil fuel reserves as then the subsidy ensures that more fossil fuel is left in situ and brings forward the date of introduction of renewables. if there is learning by doing in using renewables, a high but falling subsidy is called for to kick-start green innovation. society is in need of a rapid rather than a gradual sustainability transition driven by redirecting technical change towards clean technologies.\",\"the behavioural aspect of green technology investments: a general positive model in the context of heterogeneous agents. studies report that firms do not invest in cost-effective green technologies. while economic barriers can explain parts of the gap, behavioural aspects cause further under-valuation. this could be partly due to systematic deviations of decision-making agents\\u2019 perceptions from normative benchmarks, and partly due to their diversity. this paper combines available behavioural knowledge into a simple model of technology adoption. firms are modelled as heterogeneous agents with different behavioural responses. to quantify the gap, the model simulates their investment decisions from different theoretical perspectives. while relevant parameters are uncertain at the micro-level, using distributed agent perspectives provides a realistic representation of the macro adoption rate. the model is calibrated using audit data for proposed investments in energy efficient electric motors. the inclusion of behavioural factors reduces significantly expected adoption rates: from 81% using a normative optimisation perspective, down to 20% using a behavioural perspective. the effectiveness of various policies is tested.\",\"dialectic tensions driving niche creation \\u2013 a case study of a local energy system. local energy systems (less), such as energy communities and microgrids, are seen as significant contributors to the energy transition, but their creation requires contested institutional changes to the centralized energy regime. we explore the creation process of a groundbreaking les project from the multi-level and dialectic perspectives. our results show a tension-driven institutional change process that includes the dialectic perspective's four principles: institutional contradictions, praxis, social construction, and totality. based on the learnings of the case study, we highlight the effect of institutional contradictions on incumbent actors\\u2019 agency, boundary spanners\\u2019 role in triggering praxis, and tensions in niche\\u2013regime interactions. we show with the case study that the dialectic perspective together with the multi-level perspective aid in understanding the creation process and further aid in designing future les creation processes by providing normative descriptions of contradictions, tensions, and opportune solutions for them beforehand. we also discuss the limitations of the approach.\",\"power from above? assessing actor-related barriers to the implementation of trolley truck technology in germany. in this paper, we present a new method to operationalize social barriers for innovative technologies. technical feasibility and economic viability are no guarantee for the development and take-off of an innovation. we combine insights from multi-level perspective (mlp) and technological innovation systems (tis) theory to develop a framework for the identification and evaluation of actor-centred barriers. we illustrate the method through an application to catenary hybrid truck (cht) technology in germany. relevant stakeholders were identified via document research and subsequent network analysis, and then approached to fill out a survey. additional data was gathered using semi-structured interviews with key actors, and content analysis. we show how the implementation of cht may be hampered by resistance from the regime and by a lack of focused expectations and lobbying within the niche.\",\"qualitative and quantitative risk assessment of expanding photovoltaics in the netherlands. expanding photovoltaics (pv) is important for reaching dutch renewable energy and climate targets. in this paper, we assess risks of scaling up pv in the dutch electricity sector and economy. with a computable general equilibrium model setup to analyse scenarios until 2050, we show that increasing pv shares initially lead to higher costs of electricity supply and thus retail prices. until 2025, large storage investments will be required, leading to lower consumption possibilities presenting a critical barrier to initiate pv expansion. however, from 2025 onwards pv installation costs are expected to become competitive to wind power, leading to lower costs of electricity supply and electricity retail prices, with positive macroeconomic effects. overall, we find positive long-term effects of pv expansion on gdp, welfare and employment from 2025 until mid-century. with stakeholders we then investigate system-level obstacles for pv expansion in the netherlands. a key observation is that inconsistent policy mixes are an obstacle to successful pv implementation.\",\"eco-innovation to reduce biodiversity impacts of wind energy: key examples and drivers in the uk. wind energy technologies deliver environmental benefits in terms of reduced greenhouse gas emissions. however, they can entail other environmental impacts such as on biodiversity. this article identifies fifteen examples of innovation in the uk wind energy sector that address biodiversity impacts, and seven drivers behind these innovations. examples are categorised into six thematic areas covering eco-process, eco-organisational and eco-product innovations. eco-process and eco-organisational innovations are found to be most sensitive to institutional and political influences (such as regulation), whilst eco-product innovations are most sensitive to supply-side factors (such as cost-saving). these findings contribute to theoretical debates on the determinants of eco-innovation, as well as having implications for policymakers addressing the dual policy objectives of renewable energy deployment and biodiversity conservation.\",\"pathways for the transition of the polish power sector and associated risks. in poland, coal has been a key driver of energy security and, despite its declining role, still accounts for most of the country's power generation mix. transition potential for the fossil fuel-based power sector can be reflected in a heated debate between a coal-oriented, evolutionary process of slowly reducing emissions; and a more ambitious renewable energy-driven pathway. both pathways feature barriers; some are evident in standard economic analyses, while others are not. here, we use a bottom-up energy model to identify the optimal energy mix for the two pathways, and a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium macroeconomic model to assess their socioeconomic implications. we then employ fuzzy cognitive maps to explore which agenda appears to be favoured by stakeholders, and identify omitted risk channels associated with both pathways. finally, based on these insights, we reiterate the modelling analyses and assess the socioeconomic implications of some of the identified risk channels.\",\"an emerging innovation system for deployment of building-sited solar photovoltaics in sweden. the installed capacity for solar photovoltaic (pv) electricity production in sweden is small but rapidly growing. in this paper, the emerging innovation system for the deployment of building-sited pv systems in sweden is analysed in order to identify and assess drivers and barriers to diffusion, using a technological innovation systems (tis) approach. as the market for pv systems in sweden has grown, an increasing number and variety of actors have become engaged in pv deployment, and networks have been formed. the pv market has been utterly dependent on a government investment subsidy scheme, which has, however, effectively set a cap on the size of the market, leading to fluctuations in demand and difficulties for pv installation firms. the case study illustrates how the technological innovation systems (tis) approach can be used in a deployment context to reveal system weaknesses.\",\"expectation dynamics and niche acceleration in china's wind and solar power development. this paper addresses the question of how alignment dynamics between niche and regime actors shape niche acceleration. we develop a conceptual framework that focuses on the role of expectations as a necessary precondition and even as a key proxy for strategic collaboration between niche and regime actors. based on actors\\u2019 expectations, we conceptualise three alignment patterns of strong, medium-strong and weak alignment. we propose a 16 % threshold of niche technology adoption for substantial niche acceleration. we explore our conceptual framework in two contrasting case studies of wind and solar power development in china between 2000 and 2017. both cases experienced niche acceleration but followed different paths. our research findings indicate that the three proposed alignment patterns between niche and regime actors\\u2019 expectations can be seen as a good proxy for explaining these different paths. strong alignment between niche and regime actors\\u2019 expectations does go hand in hand with niche acceleration.\",\"closing the green finance gap \\u2013 a systems perspective. meeting its climate policy objectives requires the uk to rapidly decarbonise its energy sector. this demands high levels of investments into low carbon energy infrastructure, which are currently not undertaken at required scale, leading to a green finance gap. we explore (1) key investment barriers, (2) a theoretical framework for investigation and (3) possible solutions, drawing on a review of academic literature and policy reports, and interviews conducted with financial investors and experts. our study confirms that policy uncertainty and short-termism in the financial system are the two main investment barriers. our results show that identified barriers form a complex system characterised by path-dependency, lock-in and non-linearity. we recommend the adoption of systems theory as an analytical framework to inform the related policy debate and propose the expansion or development of sustainable investment vehicles as a useful near-term solution while preparing a long-term policy intervention based on a systems perspective.\",\"eliciting policymakers\\u2019 preferences for technologies to decarbonise transport: a discrete choice experiment. socio-technical transitions are often hindered by the resilience of existing infrastructures, as policymakers are reluctant to invest in novel products or services. using the example of carbon capture and utilisation (ccu) based fuels, we set up a discrete choice experiment to assess whether european policymakers have a tendency to avoid investing in novel, and more disruptive technologies, and rather prefer to invest in technologies that resemble the incumbent. results indicate that policymakers prefer to allocate funding to dominant technologies. the results also revealed an overall positive perception of ccu technologies among policymakers. as the commercialisation of such products and processes continues, acceptance among this group of stakeholders is key.\",\"substituting silver in solar photovoltaics is feasible and allows for decentralization in smart regional grids. photovoltaic (pv) energy is reaching full grid parity in many regions, which can trigger a global deployment of home pv panels and pv systems near municipalities. the scaling-up of conventional crystalline silicon panels to the terawatt range is not feasible due to insufficient global silver reserves. however, recent copper metallization in front and rear contacts of silicon cells avoids the use of silver. this opens the door to a rapid and wide diffusion of pv energy. intelligent grids allow the integration of decentralized and centralized generators of all types and size. a regional integration based on such grids can compensate the intermittency of pv production with the storage capacity of hydroelectricity and concentrating solar power stations. it makes the best of both systems: local autonomy through home pv and supply stability through large renewable stations.\",\"designing low carbon innovation organisations: the energy technologies institute experience. if clean energy innovation is to be accelerated at the pace required, new approaches to designing public innovation organisations need to be developed. despite the importance of these organisations in driving sustainability transitions, their role has not yet been explored in the literature. this paper addresses this gap by refining ten principles for publicly funded innovation organisation design and applying them to a detailed case study of the energy technologies institute (eti), uk. results demonstrate that the eti's design reflected broader political and industrial relationships at the time of its formation, embedding six large, incumbent energy firms. this effected its ability to pursue the riskier aspects of its mission, resulting in the pursuit of more incremental technologies and outputs. generalisable aspects of effective innovation organisation design and opportunities to further develop the principles are also identified.\",\"mere deployment of renewables or industry formation, too? exploring the role of advocacy communities for the argentinean energy policy mix. in 2014 argentina has adopted a new policy strategy aiming at the diffusion of renewable energies. in this paper, we analyze the associated policy making process and the impacts of the emerging policy mix on socio-technical change in the argentinean electricity sector, with a particular focus on the development of a national renewables industry. our analysis is based on a novel analytical framework which enriches the literature on policy mixes for sustainability transitions with concepts from the advocacy coalition framework. methodologically, we conduct a qualitative analysis drawing on document analysis and expert interviews. we find that the design of the argentinean policy mix has been influenced by a dominant advocacy community with fiscal concerns and investments in renewable energy as its main beliefs, thereby limiting national industry development. based on this we derive implications for better integrating the industrial policy dimension in policy mixes for transitions towards renewable energy.\",\"local authorities as niche actors: the case of energy governance in the uk. local level decision-making can provide a vital and practicable means through which to deliver carbon reductions at individual, household and community levels. this paper explores the opportunities and challenges associated with the role of local government action in delivering a resilient, low carbon future. drawing on qualitative data gathered through interviews with six case study local authorities in the uk, the paper examines in particular the ways in which they have tried to address energy and environmental goals in their areas of jurisdiction. the principles of multi-level perspective (mlp) are employed to provide fresh insights on the potential for local government to encourage 'niche' level influences on economic, technological and social/behavioural innovation. in doing so, we identify the enabling factors and drivers that have given rise to success in linking microlevel goals with existing macro-level objectives, as well as highlighting some of the persistent obstacles that continue to hamper progress.\",\"socio-technical transitions and policy change - advocacy coalitions in swiss energy policy. policies and politics are an integral part of socio-technical transitions but have not received much attention in the transitions literature so far. drawing on the advocacy coalition framework, our paper addresses this gap with a study on actors and coalitions in swiss energy policy. our results show that advocacy coalitions in switzerland have largely remained stable despite the fukushima shock. however, heterogeneity of beliefs has increased and in 2013, even a majority of actors expressed their support for the energy transition - an indication that major policy change might be ahead. it seems that in socio-technical transitions, changes in the policy issue and in the actor base also work toward policy change, next to changes in core beliefs. we make suggestions how the advocacy coalition framework can inform analysis and theory building in transition studies. we also present first ideas about the interplay of socio-technical systems and policy systems.\",\"strengthen finance in sustainability transitions research. given the importance of financial capital for major socio-technical transitions, a better understanding of the financial system's role in transitions is overdue. established transition frameworks appear well-suited to that end, but more research is needed to exploit their potential, particularly in the middle-range between specific case studies of individual financing challenges and broad analyses of the financial system as a whole. enhancing the representation of finance can also bridge sustainability transition research with the fast-growing scholarship on sustainable finance, showing pathways how to overcome hurdles that the financial system poses for socio-technical transitions, and to use the acceleration potential of re-directing financial capital.\",\"zero carbon homes in the uk? analysing the co-evolution of policy mix and socio-technical system. understanding how policy and policy-making processes can influence the speed and direction of socio-technical change is an important, yet underexplored research agenda in the field of sustainability transitions. this paper is the first application of a novel analytical framework which conceptualises the co-evolutionary dynamics of policy mixes and socio-technical systems, by complementing the sustainability transitions and policy mix literatures with insights from policy feedback theory. our paper is an in-depth empirical case study of the zero carbon homes policy mix in the uk which sought to promote radical change in the uk house building system. our paper makes three contributions. first, it makes an empirical contribution by analysing an example of an ambitious policy strategy in the housing sector where various policy effects and feedback mechanisms led to a loss of political support for the target, eventually leading to its abandonment, and only limited change within the socio-technical system. second, our paper produces novel insights about the effects of policy mix credibility on socio-technical change, and the underlying feedback mechanisms which influence its formation and loss. finally, based on our empirical analysis we propose conceptual refinements to the co-evolutionary framework and suggest avenues for future research explaining the dynamics of feedbacks between policy mixes and socio-technical systems. from the empirical analysis a key finding is that policy mixes need to be effectively designed in order to produce positive feedback from the outset, through the creation of resources, provision of clear information and the creation of credibility, and reforming conflicting institutional supports. in the case, ineffective initial design led to uncertainty and inertia, which did not generate sufficient positive feedback to withstand adverse economic and political conditions later on, which ultimately contributed to the abandonment of the policy mix.\",\"what matters? unlocking householders\\u2019 flexibility towards cooling automation in india. in emerging economies like india, where air conditioners are projected to triple by 2050 \\u2014 mostly from household use \\u2014 demand response programs such as cooling automation have gained currency as a suitable approach to address peak electricity from cooling demand. environmentally commoning/intentional communities are classic contexts in which flexible cooling consumption might be easily realised. utilising materialist theory and a six-month cooling automation trial and workshops with twenty households in an intentional community in south india, this study explores factors that shape householders\\u2019 pliability or rejection of cooling automation. results reveal that while commoning identity plays a significant role in householders' flexibility towards automation, extreme heat creates a clash between householders' environmental beliefs and comfort needs, altering their response to automation. we conclude by discussing the theoretical implications arising from these findings and suggest how utilities could respond to these dynamics to foster a transition to a low-carbon energy system.\",\"an institutional analysis of the japanese energy transition. while most studies of japan's energy sector have focused analysis on why japan's energy sector has managed to resist change, the aim of this study is to show how japan's energy institutions have been and continue to evolve, especially in the post-fukushima period. rather than adhering to single model of institutional analysis, the approach in this study is broader and more systematic, integrating various economic, political and sociological perspectives on institutions in order to gain insights into japan's energy transition. in so doing, this study provides new evidence on the impact of policy reforms on energy sector structure and performance and demonstrates that significant structural and institutional changes are underway in japan's energy transition.\",\"climate discourse and economic downturns: the case of the united states, 2008-2013. global progress on climate change has been stalled since the 2008 financial collapse. i consider the case of the united states and how the crash and subsequent stagnation have reduced prospects for climate solutions at the national level. i focus on discourse and the economic and cultural framing of climate protection and the environment as a luxury good, unaffordable in recessionary times. as a solution to this paralyzing framework, i consider the emergence of \\\"new economics,\\\" which employs an alternative framing at the local and regional level. new economics is fostering the creation of new forms of ownership in a range of enterprise structures that also contribute to sustainability and greenhouse gas reductions.\",\"productivity and work in the 'green economy': some theoretical reflections and empirical tests. this paper explores the concept of productivity in post-growth economies. it defines the 'productivity trap' that arises from the systematic pursuit of labour productivity and describes two solutions to this trap, each of which has some precedence in economic theory. the first is to reduce working hours - the most frequently cited avenue to combat unemployment in non-growing economies. the second is to engage in structural shifts towards low productivity growth sectors. using a simple simulation model of the uk economy we illustrate how these two strategies might combine to achieve 'deep' carbon emission reduction targets while maintaining high employment.\",\"climate crisis at city hall: how japanese communities mobilize to eliminate emissions. why do some communities develop better environmental governance outcomes than others? past research tends to focus on national governments, explaining how states with better environmental governance outcomes tend to have more resources, such as stronger government capacity, or fewer obstacles, like fewer ties to major polluting industries. this study tests whether the social capital and community-building policies of local governments improve their environmental governance outcomes. this mixed-methods study looks at the case of all 1741 japanese municipalities from 2005 to 2017, modeling greenhouse gas emissions across 4 different sectors of the economy, paired with three case studies of high performing municipalities. this study finds that cities with stronger bonding and bridging social capital bolster the institutional capacity of cities, improving the effectiveness of their emissions reduction programs. by leveraging citizens\\u2019 social ties, cities can accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions while improving civic engagement locally.\",\"an overview of the energy efficiency potential. the global economy is not particularly energy-efficient. at current levels of consumption the u.s. economy, for example, is an anemic 14% efficient - which means that the united states wastes about 86% of the energy now burned to maintain its economy. most recently, laitner et al. (2012) documented an array of untapped cost-effective energy efficiency resources roughly equivalent to 250 billion barrels of oil. that is a sufficient scale that would enable the u.s. to cut total energy needs in half compared to business-as-usual projections for the year 2050, and still maintain a robust economy.\",\"the impact of supply structure on solar home system installations in rural off-grid areas. markets have an important role in the emergence and diffusion of renewable energy technologies. this paper investigates the impact of market concentration on solar home system installations in rural off-grid energy markets of bangladesh. we use an extensive dataset that includes 4.11 million solar home systems installed in 503 markets over 15 years (2003\\u20132017). we show that an increase in the degree of market concentration reduces both the number and the total capacity of installed solar home systems after controlling for relevant demand- and supply-side factors. the marginal effect is non-linear and is particularly strong at a higher degree of market concentration. additionally, we find heterogeneous effects of market concentration depending on the size of the installed solar home system and customer group. our study implies that policymakers and development authorities should take the supply structure of rural off-grid energy markets into account when designing universal electrification policies.\",\"creating protective space for innovation in electricity distribution networks in great britain: the politics of institutional change. innovation in electricity distribution networks will be an important element in the transition to a sustainable low-carbon energy system. the nature of networks as regulated monopolies means that the locus of the evolution of protective space for innovation is regulatory institutions, and that the politics of creating protective space is the politics of institutional change. in this paper i examine the case of britain, where protective space for research, development and demonstration projects was created over the course of the 2000s in the form of funding mechanisms within the regulatory regime. the case study is used to test structural and discursive theories of gradual institutional change. i conclude that these theoretical frameworks are consistent with the evidence, but that the characterisations of change actors and of dominant policy paradigms are insufficiently flexible. i also conclude that the framework for innovation in the british regulator remains incomplete.\",\"leaders or networkers? the role of mayors in renewable energy transition. why do some cities adopt more renewable energy than others? this mixed methods study quantifies the effect that a supportive city mayor can have on his/her city's renewable energy transition. we draw on the case of sizable cities (at least 30,000 residents) in the us states of massachusetts and the japanese prefecture of chiba. we catalogue instances of mayoral support for renewables and specific companies over the last ten years drawing from online newspapers and government documents, statistical modeling, and case studies of key mayors. mayoral support to renewable power greatly improve solar adoption, but the strength of grassroots social capital in these cities can strengthen or shackle mayors' efforts, depending on the type of social capital. by highlighting the role of mayors in renewable energy, we hope to clarify in what situations mayors can make a difference in helping cities transition to renewable energy.\",\"not only peasants\\u2019 issue: stakeholders\\u2019 perceptions of failures inhibiting system innovation in nutrient economy. system innovation is often postulated as being able to solve \\u201cwicked problems.\\u201d however, it is unclear whether system innovation truly fits into the prevailing innovation system. when the finnish government committed finland to becoming a role model for nutrient recycling in 2010, it underscored the need for systemic change in the food system. as opposed to the existing linear and open-ended food system, a circular nutrient economy would require both structural and functional changes in both production and consumption, by means of technological, institutional, and social changes across numerous sectors simultaneously. we collected stakeholders\\u2019 perceptions of the barriers to the transition towards a more sustainable nutrient economy. the results were mapped into a failure framework that indicated that the policy-governance interface lacks directionality and coordination, while the enterprise-market interface creates inadequate demand articulation. furthermore, the resilience of deep-rooted structures was found to be critical and deserves more attention.\",\"australia's sustainable energy transition: the disjointed politics of decarbonisation. this paper considers australia's climate and energy policies over the period 1988\\u20132013 and assesses the degree to which these two policy domains have co-evolved to define australia's low carbon energy trajectory. it finds that climate policy and energy policy have largely been dissociated from one another. this failure of policy coordination and integration has been caused in part by attempts to reconcile clashing and competing neoliberal and weak ecological modernization discourses, and is reflected in the diverging goals and paths of each policy domain. the inability of australian governments to define and articulate a coherent narrative around a low-carbon energy future has consequently constrained australia's sustainable energy transition and led to contradictory and disjointed outcomes.\",\"the role of community leadership in the development of grassroots innovations. this article focuses on the role of community leadership in the development of grassroots innovations. it asks: when community leaders initiate energy projects, what types of skills and knowledge practices do they utilise to nurture grassroots innovations? grassroots innovations are usually driven by social and sustainability motives, and developed by civil society groups. based on a mixed methods approach including research interviews and site visits, the article draws on previous literature on community leadership, grassroots innovations and niche literature. community leadership is analysed via two in-depth community energy cases in the uk. research findings show that community leadership can aid the development of grassroots innovations, which operate in niches and require nurturing. community leadership benefits from being embedded into social networks, shared vision and decision making, but pre-existing skills and tacit knowledge also play a role. community leaders can also assist niche building by working closely with intermediary actors.\",\"a socio-technical perspective on low carbon investment challenges - insights for uk energy policy. the uk is moving into a new phase of energy governance which is characterised by significant demand for new investment to meet long term climate policy objectives and to address shorter term energy security challenges. this paper examines how contributions from the socio-technical systems approach can be operationalised to address the policy and societal challenge of large scale investments in low carbon energy infrastructure. research on socio-technical transitions explores the dynamics of long term structural change in capital intensive systems such as energy, housing and water supply, seeking to redirect them towards more sustainable long term trajectories. focusing on the uk electricity generation sector, the paper expands on three key low carbon investment challenges where socio-technical research can provide useful insights - (1) understanding long term uncertainty and investment risks; (2) avoiding technological lock-in; and (3) accelerating the diffusion of low carbon finance 'niches'.\",\"directionality in transformative innovation policy: who is giving directions?. the aim of this article is to improve knowledge about how directionality is implemented in transformative innovation policy and mission-oriented innovation policy. academic literature conceptualizes attention to societal challenges as the directionality of innovation systems. directionality requires an opening-up to include actors from the demand side of innovation processes. but this opening-up raises questions about who determines the direction of transformative change. in sweden, transformative innovation policy has taken the form of strategic innovation programmes. a case study of one programme, internet of things sweden, provides the opportunity to examine how directionality is implemented. the analysis shows how a focus on demand articulation made it possible to avoid making decisions about the direction of change. innovation projects that mimicked public procurement limited the potential for radical transformative change. however, policy layering was an enabling factor at the urban level, where regional innovation actors facilitated the participation of urban infrastructure companies.\",\"unleashing a golden age after the financial collapse: drawing lessons from history. the current crisis is not a \\\"black swan\\\" but a recurrent historical event midway along the successive technological revolutions. in contrast with other crises, the ones that follow the major technology bubbles install a vast innovation potential that can be unleashed with adequate government policies. the so-called golden ages in the past two centuries (the victorian boom, the belle \\u00e9poque, the post war golden age) have followed post-bubble recessions. after governments save the banks and jump-start the economy, they need to regulate and reorient finance toward the real economy while fostering synergistic growth in agreed directions. the article holds that the possibility is there for unleashing a golden age-national and global-by tilting the playing field in favor of \\\"green growth\\\". the question is whether the conditions for government to become proactive again are as favorable as after wwii.\",\"the effect of institutional memory on the diffusion of wind energy. memories of past experiences are at the heart of innovation processes, yet because they are difficult to operationalize, their role in the renewable energy transition remains elusive. applying the concept of spillover to operationalize institutional memory, the current study addresses this problem for the first time. it examines how different actors in a planning institution in israel reached decisions regarding 22 new wind projects by focusing on institutional memory as an explanatory variable. our findings indicate that planning institutions relied on institutional memory to make decisions regarding contentious issues. furthermore, they suggest that actors use institutional memories strategically to shape nascent rules and regulations in the regulatory vacuum of an emerging market. employing machine learning methods to study the effect of institutional memory on the diffusion of wind energy opens up new research avenues in the dynamics of unfolding diffusion processes.\",\"justice aspects of flexible household electricity consumption in future smart energy systems. as energy transitions advance through the introduction of renewable energy production and new types of energy demands, expectations for more flexible electricity consumption has risen on agendas among system designers and scholars. social scientists have followed this development through studies of technological visions and users of new flexibility techniques (e.g. demand-side management, pricing, storage). based on interviews with electricity systems developers and householders in norway this article complements this body of scholarship and relates it to emerging themes in sustainability transitions research. we focus on end-user flexibility and operationalize the new concept of flexibility capital, developed within energy justice literature, to examine different framings of flexibility. the research examines how some householders have more capability of being flexible than others. furthermore, we show how consumer understandings of flexibility are embedded in everyday life, and differs from systems developers, who primarily understands flexibility as acting economically rational and making cost-conscious decisions.\",\"the elusive quest for technology-neutral policies. it is often argued that policies to address climate change should be technology neutral. in this paper we address when and to what extent technology neutrality is warranted, and find that it is often an elusive objective that neither can nor should be prioritized as the main guiding principle.\",\"modelling energy transitions for climate targets under landscape and actor inertia. the speed at which established socioeconomic and technological systems can be adapted to alternatives that are compatible with a climate stabilised, 2 \\u00b0c world remains unknown. quantitative models used for assessing this challenge typically make a number of arguably optimistic assumptions regarding human behaviour and decision making. this often restricts the insights produced to futures approximating a so-called first-best policy landscape. however, empirical studies of socio-technical change have shown that technological diffusion is often influenced by actors and institutions interacting under less ideal, second-best conditions. this paper quantifies these factors in a formal energy model as landscape and actor inertia and employs them for the first time in blue, a dynamic stochastic socio-technical simulation of technology diffusion, energy and emissions inspired by the multi-level perspective. using the uk energy system as an example, the results illustrate how socio-technical inertia may significantly blunt future efforts to achieve climate targets.\",\"how the regime hampered a transition to renewable electricity in hungary. with respect to wind and solar electricity, hungary is a laggard in the european union. key geographical and economic factors fail to explain this. using the multi-level framework, i rely on technological and policy documents, 21 expert interviews, and more than 1500 news pieces to better understand why the breakthrough of wind and solar energy has not happened yet. i show why the nuclear industry and the government, understood as one regime, could respond to niche developments and landscape changes. early actions by the regime, limited media discussions, weak landscape pressures, and various mechanisms that characterize illiberal states were responsible for this. while motivations of the regime are not disclosed, potential reasons for the broad energy policy directions are discussed. the article highlights socio-political aspects of the compatibility of nuclear energy and renewables, and calls attention to differences between liberal and illiberal states in both transition processes and their analysis.\",\"towards a conceptualization of power in energy transitions. the field of sustainability transitions has recently benefitted from efforts by multiple scholars at better conceptualizing power and politics, and integrating insights from other fields. this article argues for an understanding of power as relational, productive, contingent and situated. i conceptualize power to the aim of understanding and explaining how and where power relations become de/stabilized in energy transitions in poor rural communities. an understanding of power as a relational capacity to act is integrated with a sociotechnical and relational understanding of constitutive power, which enables us to explore the co-production of social relations, technology and nature. the resulting conceptualization is applied to a case of mini-hydropower electrification in tanzania. i find that electrification simultaneously reinforces social inequality and enhances social mobility. i identify material, symbolic and discursive domains that work as sources of de/stabilization of social hierarchies, producing effects on the system configuration and relations of class and gender.\",\"an agent-based model of transitions in consumer lighting: policy impacts from the e.u. phase-out of incandescents. to understand the consequences of the e.u. ban on incandescent lamps, an agent-based model is developed in which consumer behaviour regarding purchase of lamps is simulated. consumers are modelled as having heterogeneous and dynamic preferences on lamps. development of preferences depends on memory and perceptions, as well as interaction in a social network structure. lighting technology is modelled to cover many different lamps and technologies. the results indicate that the ban on bulbs will be effective in realising an energy efficient sector. although the ban on bulbs causes a spike in consumers' purchases, the consequent benefits of energy saving outweigh the additional costs of purchasing these lamps. introducing a tax on incandescent lamps would also be effective given a sufficiently high tax level and could be income-neutral with respect to purchasing lamps. a possible penetration of halogen lamps may hamper the transition to lower electricity consumption.\",\"trade unions\\u2019 interpretation of a just transition in a fossil fuel economy. trade unions have received little attention in sustainability transitions research, despite their capacity to influence policy decisions. this article presents a study of how key unions in norway a country with a large petroleum sector as well as high union level density \\u2013 have moved their preferences on transition issues in the period 2007\\u20132019. with a document-based process analysis of trade unions\\u2019 changing policy preferences and interpretations of a just transition, a concept that aims to bridge the apparent gap between destruction and creation policies, we show how trade unions have used this concept to reconcile different positions among unions. while unions from petroleumrelated sectors are more opposed to phase-out policies compared to non-petroleum unions, the solidarity principle among unions has caused some movement towards a joint support of a just transition. yet, different unions promote different ideas of what a just transition means depending on their sector affiliation.\",\"transformative innovation policy: a systematic review. this paper reviews the emerging literature on \\u201ctransformative\\u201d innovation policy (tip) in order to (1) identify unique tip characteristics and the challenges they imply for policymakers throughout the policy cycle and (2) examine the literature's contribution to practical policymaking. we identify five main distinguishing tip characteristics and analyse the literature's understanding of how they influence the policymaking process. the analysis shows that the literature discusses tip-related challenges in all stages of the policy cycle but does not provide much guidance on how to address key cross-cutting policymaking challenges such as how to achieve broad stakeholder involvement, evaluate transformative outcomes, and build up dynamic policymaker capabilities. in order for tip ideas to be implemented in real-life policymaking, tip scholars, therefore, need to more explicitly consider the practitioners\\u2019 perspective and develop concrete models, tools and guidelines that help policymakers address the identified challenges.\",\"utilising law in the transition of the kingdom of saudi arabia to a low-carbon economy. the kingdom of saudi arabia (ksa) has adopted a new law and policy framework, vision 2030, designed to deliver a transition to a diversified and low-carbon economy. this paper analyses from an environmental law and policy perspective how law is providing opportunities and challenges in achieving the outcomes of this national masterplan. the paper employs traditional legal scholarship to assess the law itself and also explores its impact in practice, via an analysis of findings from expert stakeholder interviews. key issues around environmental governance are discussed in depth in the light of vision 2030. one of the key issues of focus is that of integration, in terms of the design and practice of law, institutions and outcomes. to date, it is clear that the further policies needed to ensure that environmental integration and a low-carbon transition take place are currently being created in the effort to deliver the aims of the vision. this study finds that the transition to a low-carbon economy in the ksa is under-researched and under-explored in practice, from an environmental perspective. the findings attest that although some significant actions have been initiated, further action needs to be taken, given the importance of this transition, in the ksa in the light of the promising nature of vision 2030 in this regard.\",\"ten financial actors can accelerate a transition away from fossil fuels. investors have a central role to play in sustainability transitions, due to their inordinate influence on the governance of the fossil fuel extraction industry. using network analysis, this paper links fossil fuel firms to equity owners, by distinguishing ownership characteristics of top shareholders and establishing a ranked list of the most prevalent shareholders based on emissions potential and network centrality. our study reveals that among the most prevalent owners, are government signatories of the paris accord and prominent american investment managers. we conclude that a concentrated number of investors have the potential to influence the strategic direction and governance of these firms and should consequently be held accountable for financing the economic activities that contribute to climate instability. this paper directly contributes to the fragmented body of academic research on financial systems and sustainability transitions.\",\"crossing the biorefinery valley of death? actor roles and networks in overcoming barriers to a sustainability transition. pilot and demonstration plants (pdps) play important roles in technological development; representing bridges between basic knowledge generation and technological breakthroughs and industrial application and commercial adoption. moreover, they also help pursue socio-technical goals, not least by creating arenas where key actors\\u2019 agency can be linked to the broader systemic context. this paper addresses the importance of the actor networks around pdp. the aim is to propose a role-based typology that can be used as an illustrative tool to facilitate a more generic analysis of pdp actor networks and their dynamics. for this purpose the paper pursues a primarily inductive approach to investigate the barriers experienced by the actors in their joint efforts to further transform the pdps and gain a broader legitimacy for the new technologies after the initial technology verification and demonstration phases. to aid the analysis, the actor networks surrounding four swedish biorefinery pdps are investigated empirically.\",\"the importance of stakeholders in scoping risk assessments\\u2014lessons from low-carbon transitions. identifying the risks that could impact a low-carbon transition is a prerequisite to assessing and managing these risks. we systematically characterise risks associated with decarbonisation pathways in fifteen case studies conducted in twelve countries around the world. we find that stakeholders from business, government, ngos, and others supplied some 40 % of these risk inputs, significantly widening the scope of risks considered by academics and experts. overall, experts and academics consider more economic risks and assess these with quantitative methods and models, while other stakeholders consider political risks more. to avoid losing sight of risks that cannot be easily quantified and modelled, including some economic risks, impact assessment modelling should be complemented with qualitative research and active stakeholder engagement. a systematic risk elicitation facilitates communication with stakeholders, enables better risk mitigation, and increases the chance of a sustainable transition.\",\"incumbent energy companies navigating energy transitions: strategic action or bricolage?. the behaviour of incumbent energy companies is critical for a transition to a sustainable energy system. we address the recent call for closer conceptualisation of power and agency within transition studies by combining concepts of strategic action fields (fligstein and mcadam, 2012) and the flat-ontology perspective of arenas of development (j\\u00f8rgensen, 2012) to identify potential ruptures emerging on the micro scale in the field of sustainable energy. we investigate how new actor configurations in new experimental arenas open field rules for renegotiation. we provide a long-term analysis on how traditional energy field rules have emerged, how two of the most powerful energy companies in finland have responded to the emergence of sustainable energy and how new forms of collaborations are emerging in the space created by new arenas of development that create ruptures within the incumbent energy coalition.\",\"branching points and transition pathways in the greek natural gas regime, 1966\\u20132016. this paper studies the emerging natural gas transitions in greece from 1966 to 2016. we place the actors and the governing processes in historical perspective, to position the regime actors, their power and their agency in the context of decision making that influenced the transition pathway and its key branching points. we argue that during the two transitions there was a passage from years of politicized visions promoted and dominated by national and local actors to years of contested visions of greece as a transnational natural gas corridor, promoted both by national and transnational actors. there has been a reconfiguration of the governance logics action space because of the increasing agency and power of transnational actors (the eu and the \\u2018troika\\u2019) especially at times of political or financial crisis. the paper shows the importance of considering how transitions are affected by asymmetries in power and agency between national and international actors and indeed between different actors in a state.\",\"evaluating the global impact of low-carbon energy transitions on social equity. this research examines the societal impacts of varying energy policy approaches and the progress of the energy transition toward a low carbon energy-based regime internationally. using indicators relevant to energy policy and the energy transition, five critical social equity impacts of environmental improvement, health, employment, participation, and energy cost are investigated from the viewpoint of an \\u2018equitable\\u2019 energy transition. we investigate the correlation between quantitative social equity impacts and the shift toward new renewable energy-based electricity (i.e., wind, photovoltaic, geothermal, tidal, biomass etc.) from 1990 to 2015, for 99 nations with differing development levels, energy resources and policies. we find that increased levels of new renewable energy deployment generally accompany social equity improvement, however geography, national income level and complementary energy policies are also important. our results highlight specific issues for developing nations, whereby electricity needs are often met by fossil fuels prior to the large-scale penetration of renewables. these nations enjoy short-term social equity benefits, at the risk of long-term negative social equity outcomes. this study's holistic evaluation of energy transitions and social equity outcomes could be used as an input to proactive policy development contributing to the realization of a more equitable energy transition.\",\"challenges for electricity network governance in whole system change: insights from energy transition in norway. once transitions progress beyond the start-up phase, niche technologies diffuse more widely to generate important knock-on effects in a focal sector. this entails a need for moving beyond niches to embrace a 'whole system perspective'. in the power sector, this perspective puts electricity networks in a more central position. this paper analyses how the governance of power networks is challenged by the energy transition. we integrate insights from network regulation and transition studies to propose a framework for understanding such challenges. with this framework we assess recent regulatory innovations in norway. the paper shows how the regulatory toolbox can be amended to tackle innovation and transition. the norwegian case shows that the regulator has taken up the energy transition challenges. it also shows the difficulties of making these new instruments effective, including the tension between a regulatory cost-efficiency focus on the one hand, and transformative change on the other.\",\"economic-financial crisis and sustainability transition: introduction to the special issue. a brief introduction to the special issue on \\\"economic-financial crisis and sustainability transition\\\" is provided. the relevance of this theme is motivated and core questions are formulated. the editorial ends with a brief summary of the various contributions, which include six long articles and four short viewpoints.\",\"a transition to green buildings in norway. energy use in buildings is a significant contributor to climate change. the purpose of this paper is to explore industrial changes towards sustainability in the norwegian construction industry, adding to debates about transitions to sustainability and transition pathways in a traditional, low-tech sector. empirically the paper reports a case of cumulative changes in the norwegian construction industry over from 1998 to 2013. the case explores a complex innovation and diffusion process where technologies, visions, actors and policy co-evolve over time to transform an existing socio-technical regime. findings indicate that the transition moved forward through interplay between innovations in niches, a growing constituency around green building and a string of regulative and market changes.\",\"analyzing sectoral niche formation: the case of net-zero energy buildings in india. large scale development of net zero energy buildings (nzebs) is seen as a potential solution to deal with future energy challenges in the building sector. this article aims to assess the current status of nzeb development in india by using an integrated framework named sectoral system innovation assessment framework (ssiaf). the article addresses the research question: \\u201c\\u201cwhat does the ssia framework tell about nzeb niche formation in india?\\u201d the ssiaf is developed using insights from the theoretical frameworks of strategic niche management (snm) and sectoral innovation systems (sis) with five key components: shaping of expectations, social network formation, institutions, learning process and market demand. a case study research design was used to analyze seven nzeb demonstration projects in india. the results show that the nzeb innovation niche has yet to develop into a mature niche, and is growing only slowly.\",\"transition policy and innovation policy: friends or foes?. there is a potential for misalignment between innovation policy and transition policy. this misalignment might hamper sustainability transitions. this paper discusses the sources of the incompatibilities between innovation and transition policy and gives policy recommendations on how to increase the area of alignment.\",\"comparing energy transitions in germany and spain using a political economy perspective. during the 2000s, germany and spain were forerunners in europe's energy transition. however, after the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2007 a growing divergence in the two countries\\u2019 energy policy paths can be observed. this article applies a political economy perspective to explore the reasons for this divergence. in investigating this empirical puzzle, the work identifies two main causes of the differing developments in the two countries. the first cause being that spain was hit much harder by the financial and economic crisis and the second, that the spanish energy transition was an elite-driven process whereas the german energiewende was driven by large sectors of civil society. regarding the theoretical question of how to understand the divergent developments of the countries\\u2019 energy politics, a perspective based on regulation theory and antonio gramsci's political theory can help offer an understanding of the social character of energy transitions.\",\"zero emission housing: policy development in australia and comparisons with the eu, uk, usa and california. a change to a zero emission housing future requires significant innovation in both policy and practice, as described by socio-technical transitions theory. this paper examines emerging policies towards zero emission housing standards from the eu, uk, usa, california and australia to determine alignment with socio-technical transitions criteria. this analysis is then positioned within the australian context, which is characterised by a lack of policy innovation. the limitations of existing regulatory approaches are identified. the analysis finds that a number of key socio-technical transitions elements are addressed in the case studies, but there are also elements that are absent or inadequately dealt with. five key transitions elements are identified as being developed only to a limited extent in the australian context, namely long-term goals, pathways, links to wider policies, financial innovation, and the inclusion of wider social elements. consideration of these elements in future minimum energy performance standards could facilitate a transition to zero emission housing.\",\"compatibility in cross-city innovation transfer: importance of existing local experiments. despite a growing body of literature on how to broaden urban sustainability experiments, the research community still lacks a comprehensive understanding of the factors that enable and obstruct real-world applications. one under-studied aspect is the compatibility of an incoming external experiment with existing experimentation in the contextualization process. we address this knowledge gap by using an inter-city learning case study of a food waste management experiment. the australian capital territory is the hypothetical receptor city for an experiment first conducted in milan. we conducted interviews and surveys to examine the institutional, technical, and attitudinal opportunities and barriers. we show that existing local experimentation should be considered alongside those factors. we conceptualize different modes of compatibility between the external experiment and existing local experimentation and call for greater attention to compatibility in both research and practice of broadening sustainability experiments.\",\"intermediating the energy transition across spatial boundaries: cases of sweden and spain. systemic intermediaries play an important role in shaping socio-technical transitions. however, there is hardly any knowledge about contextual factors that enhance or inhibit systemic intermediary activities in transnational settings. this study draws on a case study of a european intermediary in the energy transition field. the intermediary has been active in both transition-progressive and less transition-oriented countries in europe. in specific, we investigate the intermediary's activities in sweden and spain. due to local factors, the intermediary's approach was difficult to realize in sweden. most activities were performed with niche-actors or universities only, undermining systemic intermediation. by contrast, spanish local factors favored systemic intermediation, allowing the regime and niche levels to converge. the findings of the study extend the literature by showing why intermediation in transition-progressive regions can suffer and by highlighting that transnational intermediaries entering a transition-progressive region must account for the local intermediation ecology when defining their role.\",\"the crisis behind the crisis. the present crisis is a financial crisis only at the surface. in actual truth there is a much more consequential growth crisis behind it. this \\\"view point\\\" discusses why this is so and what consequences follow from this diagnosis when seeking for remedies for the crisis. particular attention is given in the discussion to the fact that the crisis occurs just at a time when the necessity to cope with the climate change is getting ever more pressing.\",\"responding to the financial crisis: need for a new economics. this viewpoint argues that the financial crisis has also highlighted the failings of mainstream economic thinking, at both micro and macro-economic levels, in providing adequate and appropriate understanding of how economies work. as a result, it cannot inform well decisions by policy-makers. in particular, mainstream economics has neglected the complexity of systemic interactions and behavioural factors underlying modern economies, as well as the systemic dependence of economies on natural resources and ecosystem services. this piece discusses four heterodox economic approaches that could contribute to the development of a new economics. by focussing on what these approaches tell us about particular problems, a more realistic and useful economics can be developed, which can address the current economic challenges in ways consistent with realising a transition to a sustainable future.\",\"barriers to and consequences of a solar-based energy transition in greece. in greece, the renewable energy potential and a low-quality building stock constitute the background of a possible low-carbon energy transition. this transition, however, faces significant uncertainties, ranging from long-term effects of the ongoing economic recession and technological lock-ins, to the stability of the regulatory framework and issues of public acceptance. such uncertainties may eventually give rise to significant barriers to, as well as severe economic and social consequences of, the envisaged transition. here, in a structured approach to eliciting the knowledge embedded in stakeholders, we identify such risks and explore their dynamics and role in a sustainable transition to a power system that is based on large-scale solar projects and prosuming in the residential sector. we then employ a modelling ensemble, consisting of a macroeconomic dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model and a business strategy assessment model, in order to quantify and evaluate the extent of the identified risks\\u2019 impact.\",\"adaptive policy innovations and the construction of emission trading schemes in china: taking stock and looking forward. harnessing market instruments of climate governance, such as emission trading schemes (ets) into an authoritarian and highly fragmented governance system like china can be challenging. it requires tremendous efforts from local states for policy experiments and innovations. this paper examines these local adaptive measures to develop pilot ets around china. the key finding is that these local policy innovations have played an important role to kick off carbon trading activities effectively, by addressing a number of challenges such as highly imbalanced economic and political contexts, very limited emissions data and technological capacity, and low participants\\u2019 awareness of ets. the implications of such policy innovations to the construction of a nationwide ets system are also discussed. some of local policy innovations can be legitimised and adopted into the design of national carbon market, while others are more likely appreciated only at initial stage of market development at local level.\",\"climate change and economic growth enigma: an investment suggestion from wall street. a unique opportunity to deal with climate change and stimulate faster economic growth exists today because of the 2007-2009 financial crisis coincidence with secular structural changes in the global economy. a massive investment shift from fossil to non-fossil fuels could offset sub-par economic growth and high unemployment in the developed economies caused by the financial crisis and aggravated by demographic trends and the shift of economic dynamism to emerging markets. the 2008 and dot.com crises demonstrate that our financial system is inherently unstable and that \\\"bubbles\\\" are not only inevitable but occur at shorter intervals and inhibit long-term investment. financing massive investment in non-fossil fuels could be done, however, with long-term securities whose rate of return, based on exergy efficiency improvement, would attract global institutional investors with long-term investment needs. such a massive new securities market would reduce the volatility and systemic risks inherent in today's wall street-with-wall street markets.\",\"unravelling institutional work patterns: planning offshore wind farms in contested space. offshore wind farms (owf) are considered important for a timely energy transition. however, offshore space is governed by sector-specific institutional frameworks representing various and sometimes conflicting interests. therefore, institutional change towards improved cooperation and coordination between various stakeholders, their interests and alternative institutional frameworks is necessary. institutional work is used as an analytical lens to explore patterns resulting from the interplay between different forms of institutional work by actors over time. data was collected through participatory observation of the dutch north sea dialogues (nsd) and focused on balancing interest in the context of multi-use of ofw. institutional change in this case relied mostly on a highly subtle interplay between forms of creating and maintaining work that result in incremental changes to existing practices. sustainability transitions could benefit from institutional harmonization as a pathway to institutional change for improved cross-sectoral coordination and cooperation.\",\"fostering a local energy transition in a post-socialist policy setting. we explore the conditions critical for the enactment of ambitious local energy transition in a post-socialist renewable energy policy environment that constrains local initiatives. we analyse the island of krk (croatia) as a unique case of shared vision of 100 % renewable energy in post-socialist countries. we apply kingdon's multiple-streams approach to advance the understanding of policy change in transitions literature by examining problem, policy and political streams. we investigate the political and policy landscape, multidimensional roles and interactions of key actors, and the governance mode. the underlying mechanism consists of the island community's common interest \\u2013 tourism, unprecedented political stability, and synchronized policy actions by the local self-governments, where the public utility inspires policy entrepreneurs to pursue new niches and policy proposals. a novel, inclusive and horizontal governance mode focused on island-level steering secures high-level support for new policy initiatives through coordination and a sense of co-creation and co-ownership.\",\"incumbent resistance and the solar transition: changing opportunity structures and framing strategies. sustainability transitions often involve policy conflicts, especially when incumbents perceive threats to their business models, and conflicts involve framing of competing positions in the public sphere. using the case of the growth of distributed solar energy in the u.s. electricity sector, this study shows how the concepts of industry and political opportunity structures can help to explain variation in discursive strategy. first, when incumbents perceive the growth of the challenger as a threat, the industry opportunity structure closes, the volume of framing activity in the public sphere increases as contention grows, and the differentiation in framing (the ratio of pro- to anti-transition frames) between incumbents and challengers increases. second, with respect to the political opportunity structure, the selection of frame types (environmental versus economic-consumer) varies in relationship to control of the government by conservative or progressive parties. theoretical implications for transitions studies are discussed.\",\"risk assessment of the low-carbon transition of austria's steel and electricity sectors. to limit global temperature increase below +2\\u00b0c, societies need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions radically within the next few decades. amongst other mitigation measures, this requires transforming process-emission intensive industries towards emission neutrality. one way to this end is the renewables-based electrification of industries. we present results of a recent co-production process which brought together stakeholders from industry, policy, administration and science to co-create climate-neutral transition pathways for the steel and electricity sectors in austria. the results summarized here are the definition of reliable pathways and the identification of associated risks pertaining to pathway implementation, including a macro-economic quantification. we find that risks to implementation (barriers) are at least as important as risks of implementation (negative consequences). from the quantitative analysis we find that, provided that barriers can be reduced, macroeconomic costs of the transition are only moderate and that stakeholders might overestimate risks, when neglecting economy-wide feedbacks.\",\"a new hybrid approach for evaluating technology risks and opportunities in the energy transition in ireland. we combine energy systems optimization models (esom), multi-criteria assessment (mca) and a stakeholder workshop to evaluate decarbonization risks, trade-offs and opportunities for ireland. using an esom of ireland, we develop decarbonisation scenario ensembles with variations across multiple dimensions, including carbon budget and technology availability as informed by a stakeholder workshop. for these scenario ensembles, we quantify investment risk and technology robustness and use these new attributes to conduct an mca of technology risks, trade-offs and opportunities. results include an assessment of technology opportunities for two investor archetypes, i.e., risk minimizing and return maximizing, and a sensitivity analysis of the mca weights using monte carlo simulation. this represents a new methodology which demonstrates a synthesis of insights into technology opportunities associated with ireland's energy transition and their resilience across risk and economic criteria. by incorporating and displaying results for a diversity of perspectives, this work underlines the importance of transdisciplinary research.\",\"adoption and diffusion of heating systems in norway: coupling agent-based modeling with empirical research. sophisticated modeling techniques can help policy makers examine technology interventions aimed at addressing climate change mitigation and other environmental issues. since adoption of a new technology is not only based on technical properties, policy makers must also consider human behavior. this paper presents a model for simulating heating system adoption processes from an end-user perspective. a literature review was carried out to identify potential decision-making variables and their relationships. an empirical survey was then conducted to test the variables and their interconnections as well as to derive model parameters. the empirically grounded agent-based model is able to reproduce the general patterns of heating system diffusion observable in norway. the results suggest that increased adoption of wood-pellet heating is dependent on improved functional reliability and the improvement of fuel stability. price volatility of both wood-pellets and electricity are important variables. spatial results indicate that wood-pellet adopters are those closeby wood-pellet suppliers.\",\"grand visions and pragmatic integration: exploring the evolution of europe's electricity regime. in this paper we develop a socio-technical analysis of the european electricity system. we show that the relationship between high-level grand visions of an integrated european system and more pragmatic bottom-up processes of electricity system development have been a feature of the european regime for coordinating cross-border electricity flows since the 1920s. following a period when radically different visions of a european system were proposed, the nation-state emerged as the key site of system building and constituted the core of the technological and institutional configuration. however, european grand visions persisted and this led to the creation of various forms of transnational collaboration and coordination. we discuss whether this inherited technological and institutional configuration is compatible with the contemporary desire for a european low-carbon transition and we emphasise the need for more detailed analysis of socio-technical regimes and their dynamics to inform policy and enrich transitions theory.\",\"why energy's economic weight is much larger than its cost share. energy conversion and entropy production determine the growth of wealth in industrialized economies. novel econometric analyses have revealed energy to be a production factor whose output elasticity, which measures its economic weight, is much higher than its share in total factor cost, while for labor just the opposite is true. although this result is at variance with neoclassical economic theory, it is compatible with the standard maximization of profit or time-integrated utility if appropriate technological constraints on capital, labor, and energy are taken into account. shifting the burden of taxes and levies from labor to energy is an adequate policy consequence.\",\"an agent-based model of farmer behaviour to explain the limited adaptability of flemish agriculture. transition projects have been implemented for flemish agriculture since 2003, but these did not enable a transformation of the agricultural sector. this paper looks at pre-transition scenarios that have been collectively designed by stakeholders of the agricultural sector in 2002. these foresaw decreases in the regional animal stocks in flanders. however, the real evolution of the sector did not reveal such a decrease. it is assumed that the individual adaptive behaviour of farmers can explain the unexpected stability of the flemish agricultural sector. a detailed agent-based model has been built to replicate the past evolution, accounting for structural diversity of farmers, heterogeneity in behaviour, and natural resource constraints. the results indicate that different forms of rigidity in the individual behaviour of farmers slow down the adaptation of the agricultural sector. future transition scenarios should account for these elements in order not to overestimate the speed of change in the sector.\",\"exploring agenda-setting of offshore energy innovations: niche-regime interactions in dutch marine spatial planning processes. the foreseen large-scale growth of offshore wind energy towards 2050 in pursuit of an energy transition obliges scholars and policymakers to start considering its integration in the wider offshore energy system. both technological innovations and advances in spatial policy are necessary to facilitate offshore system integration. this study draws from agenda-setting theory to explore barriers and opportunities affecting the prioritization processes surrounding three offshore energy storage and transport concepts in dutch marine spatial planning practice. the findings demonstrate that although various arenas for agenda-setting exist, they are geared to the input of established stakeholders, including the oil and gas and offshore wind sectors. also, prioritization is hindered by a short-term (2030) governmental fixation and long-term institutional ambiguity. therefore, supportive institutions are needed, providing regulatory certainty and reliable incentive mechanisms, whilst remaining adaptive to address imminent uncertainties, in pursuit of system integration needed for an energy transition.\",\"modelling the socio-political feasibility of energy transition with system dynamics. a system dynamics model of energy transition, tempest, represents political and societal factors along with energy, emissions and mitigation measures, within a system of feedbacks. tempest simulates energy transition from 1980 to 2080, calibrated to uk historical data. an exogenous uncertainty analysis showed most cases would achieve net zero before 2080, but only 20% would stay within the required carbon budget. low probability, high impact cases have twice the future cumulative emissions than the best cases. high political capital for energy transition early on would likely reduce total mitigation required, but risks public pushback. endogenous uncertainty about pushback and new measure difficulty could increase total emissions by a quarter. dealing with unwanted feedbacks between society and government that reduce political capital will require responsive policy making. the socio-political feasibility of achieving the uk's net zero target is likely less than the techno-economic feasibility estimated through standard energy systems models.\",\"risk blindness in local perspectives about the alberta oil sands hinders canada's decarbonization. local perspectives can conflict with national and international climate targets. this study explores three stakeholder (community, provincial, and federal) perspectives on the alberta oil sands as risks for a sustainability transition in canada. in an ex-post analysis, we compared outputs from stakeholder consultations and energy-economy models. our research shows that different local stakeholders groups disregarded some policy risks for the alberta oil sands and canadian energy transition. these stakeholders expected the sector to grow, despite increasing environmental penalties and external market pressures. the study revealed that blind-spots on risks, or \\u201crisk blindness\\u201d, increased as stakeholders became less certain about policy climate goals. we argue that \\u201crisk blindness\\u201d could be amplified by dominant institutional narratives that contradict scientific research and international climate policy. strategies that integrate local narratives, considered as marginalized, provide perspectives beyond emission reductions and are essential for meeting climate targets while supporting a just transition.\",\"heating in great britain: an incumbent discourse coalition resists an electrifying future. the power of incumbent actors to affect sustainability transitions is increasingly recognised as a central issue associated with systemic change. however, incumbent's approaches and the outcome of their influence is rarely examined in academic literature. using a novel approach which combines the lens of \\u2018discourse coalitions\\u2019 with an explicitly critical discursive stance, in which the coalition's storyline is scrutinised, this interdisciplinary analysis investigates a pro-gas, incumbent led coalition present in the great britain (gb) energy system. in response to the threat of electrification, the coalition presents decarbonising the gas grid with replacement gases as the optimal route for heat decarbonisation. however, much analysis suggests a significant need for heat electrification and our review highlights major uncertainties with a decarbonised gas pathway. incumbents are over-selling 'green-gas' to policy makers in order to protect their interests and detract from the importance and value of electrification. policy and research recommendations are made.\",\"exploring incumbents\\u2019 agency: institutional work by grid operators in decentralized energy innovations. the agency of incumbents has gained increasing attention in the study of transitions. recent studies show that besides being inert and resistant to change, incumbents can also support transitions. we focus on the agency of a particular type of incumbent, grid operators. in several countries, these actors play an active role in institutional change in the energy domain. at the same time, they are engaging in activities to maintain the regime. this paper examines the actions of grid operators when performing institutional work, i.e. when creating, maintaining and disrupting institutions. we conducted a qualitative content analysis of dutch media to analyze the actions of grid operators while engaging with decentralized energy innovations. we conclude that grid operators are both subject and object of institutional work as part of a distributed, collective process of institutional change. furthermore, our analysis reflects on their paradoxical position as embedded actors engaging in institutional change.\",\"the role of politics in sustainable transitions: the rise and decline of offshore wind in norway. this paper studies how political conditions and external events influenced the rise and fall of offshore wind on the political agenda in norway between 2005 and 2012. in this sense, the paper contributes to recent debates about the role of politics in sustainable transitions. key findings are that changes in government posts combined with a need for the offshore petroleum industry to diversify created favourable conditions for offshore wind. however, offshore wind as a solution to articulated problems was insufficiently developed when the window of opportunity opened up. the analysis then shows how a recovery in the offshore petroleum industry and new changes inside government closed the window of opportunity. the paper concludes that we should attend more to the interests of government actors, and conflicts inside government, in the analysis of energy transitions.\",\"green growth, green paradox and the global economic crisis. a schumpeterian case can be made for boosting green growth in a global economic crisis. the best way to achieve this is a combination of r&d subsidies to redirect growth from polluting to clean economic activities and a credible, rising carbon tax to speed up the transition to the carbon-free era. if a carbon tax is infeasible, renewables subsidies might be a second-best alternative to reduce the duration of the fossil fuel era and curb cumulative carbon emissions despite some adverse, short-run green paradox effects.\",\"alternative liquid fuels in the uk in the inter-war period (1918\\u20131938): insights from a failed energy transition. against a backdrop of growing interest in low carbon alternatives to petroleum derived liquid fuels, this paper analyses two early attempts to develop alternative liquid fuels to rival petrol, the incumbent fuel. we focus on two alternatives manufactured in the uk during the inter-war period (1918\\u20131938), a power alcohol and a petrol-from-coal. both fuels received government support during a time of rapid growth in the motor industry, fluctuating economic conditions and fears of absolute oil shortages. governance of fuel distribution in particular had significant effects on the economic feasibility of both fuels and their ability to penetrate a market dominated by the oil industry incumbents. the paper presents a rich, complex story of how the development of these fuels interacted with fluctuating political perceptions of energy security, changes in the framing of energy and shifts in governance, in what were to become failed attempts at path creation and transition.\",\"systems-dynamic analysis of employment and inequality impacts of low-carbon investments. this paper provides a macroeconomic framework to evaluate the social and economic consequences generated by a shift of investment to low-carbon options. we introduce into a standard growth framework a modified lotka\\u2013volterra model for wage and employment determination to address both the long-run dynamics of the economic system in terms of carbon emission and gdp growth and the short-term macroeconomic fluctuations in terms of unemployment and inequality. we use this framework to compare the results of different combinations of three strategies for carbon emissions reductions: improvement in energy efficiency, expansion of the renewable energy sector, and the direct reduction in carbon emissions. we show that the shift to low-carbon investment required to achieve the targeted reductions increases employment and the labour share but slows down gdp growth and wages.\",\"interactions between systemic problems in innovation systems: the case of energy-efficient houses in the netherlands. the innovation systems approach offers a framework to identify what inhibits the generation, diffusion and implementation of innovations. it prescribes that interventions should target systemic problems that inhibit the system from functioning well. in current literature, systemic problems are typically identified independent from each other, after which interventions are formulated for each one separately. the following will argue that, next to the problems themselves, also the interactions between the problems are of key importance when designing intervention strategies. we analyze the dutch energy-efficient housing innovation system and conclude that neglecting interactions between systemic problems may not only lead to inaccurate problem diagnosis, but also to ineffective or even counterproductive interventions.\",\"a grassroots sustainable energy niche? reflections on community energy in the uk. system-changing innovations for sustainability transitions are proposed to emerge in radical innovative niches. 'strategic niche management' theory predicts that niche-level actors and networks will aggregate learning from local projects, disseminating best practice, and encouraging innovation diffusion. grassroots innovations emerging from civil society are under-researched, and so we investigate the uk community energy sector to empirically test this model. our analysis draws on qualitative case study research with local projects, and a study of how intermediary organisations support local projects. we examine the extent and nature of interactions and resource flows between projects and intermediary actors in order to evaluate the utility of niche theories in the civil society context. while networking and intermediary organisations can effectively spread some types of learning necessary for diffusion, this is not sufficient: tacit knowledge, trust and confidence are essential to these projects' success, but are more difficult to abstract and translate to new settings. we discuss the implications of our findings for niche theory, for community energy and other grassroots practitioners aiming to build robust influential niches, and for policymakers.\",\"integrating industrial policies with innovative infrastructure plans to accelerate a sustainability transition. following the 2008 global crisis, infrastructure plans and green industrial policies have been two separate pillars of many recovery strategies. integrating infrastructure investment plans and green industrial policies would both reduce infrastructure obduracy and increase green industrial policy efficiency.\",\"challenges for implementing renewable energy in a cooperative-driven off-grid system in the philippines. implementing renewable energy on philippine islands is essential for sustainable development. electric cooperatives play a key role to provide renewable energy to marginalized and remote communities not profiting from private sector interest. however, a low-carbon transformation of energy systems implies political, economic, technical, and societal risks and uncertainties. here, we investigate those faced by the romblon electric cooperative (romelco) in installing one of the philippines\\u2019 first off-grid, hybrid energy system in the small and remote island of cobrador. we apply a transdisciplinary mixed methods approach including expert interviews, surveys, and focus group discussions. we identify the most serious implementation risk faced by romelco as the discontinuity between the policy pronouncement and implementation practice. we contribute with an analysis of romelco's actions to address the complex bundle of implementation policies and programs for a wider replication and scaling up of cooperative based power supply.\",\"shifting political power in an era of electricity decentralization: rescaling, reorganization and battles for influence. the energy transition is increasingly high stakes, defined by the participation of new actors, and \\u2013 above all \\u2013 political. renewable energy communities (recs) are electricity system actors defined by local control and motivations beyond profit maximization. there has been much speculation about the potential impact of recs on political systems, but little empirical investigation. this study examines (a) if recs are shifting larger political power structures, (b) the mechanisms through which shifts are occurring, and (c) the implications of shifts for the future. it compares across the netherlands, united kingdom and ontario, canada. findings reveal that political power is shifting but outright policy wins are rare. recs are gaining capacity, building political coalitions and benefiting from changing norms. however, they are challenged by pressures from incumbents to maintain centralised ownership and control. energy action, both sanctioned and subversive, is rescaling toward local levels. implications for energy and social policies are significant.\",\"discursive regime dynamics in the dutch energy transition. since its introduction in the national environmental policy plan in 2001 the notion of 'energy transition' is firmly rooted in the dutch energy debate. despite political efforts to shift to a sustainable energy system, the netherlands is lagging behind other european countries. scholarly literature generally ascribes such slow developments to the dominant role of incumbents. in this paper we explore how prominent incumbents of the dutch energy system discursively frame the energy transition by unravelling their existing and evolving storylines. our results show that decarbonization in the context of a european energy market is currently seen as the dominant driver for the energy transition, linked to discursive elements on keeping the energy supply secure and affordable. we found tensions within this dominant storyline and emerging storylines with the potential to undermine the dominant one. in response, incumbents are discursively repositioning themselves, thereby restructuring coalitions - possibly indicating discursive regime destabilization.\",\"mission-oriented innovation systems. rather than merely supporting r&d and strengthening innovation systems, the focus of innovation policy is currently shifting towards addressing societal challenges by transforming socio-economic systems. a particular trend within the emerging era of transformative innovation policy is the pursuit of challenge-based innovation missions, such as achieving a 50 % circular economy by 2030. by formulating clear and ambitious societal goals, policy makers are aiming to steer the directionality and adoption of innovation. in the absence of suitable frameworks to understand and enhance the impact of missions, we introduce the notion of mission-oriented innovation systems (mis). mis consists of networks of agents and sets of institutions that contribute to the development and diffusion of innovative solutions with the aim to define, pursue and complete a societal mission. we provide several promising research avenues, including how mis come into existence, how they are governed and how the interactions taking place in a mis may influence directionality and technological variety.\",\"transitioning from coal: toward a renewables-based socio-technical regime in saskatchewan. this article analyzes the third (1994) and fourth (2015) epochs of saskatchewan's energy system and the actors and their networks associated with the transition into a renewable future. a case study method was employed using analyses of the structural, institutional and historical context of power production and energy systems transitions in saskatchewan. the historic rise of coal is discussed but analysis focuses on the displacement of coal and the era of decarbonization and renewables. actors, their problemitizations, and narrative processes complement the discussion of transitions away from coal and advancing renewables. the analysis provides policy implications for future coal phase-out including the rise of renewable cooperatives and prosumers.\",\"post carbon pathways: a meta-analysis of 18 large-scale post carbon economy transition strategies. this article summarises findings from a review of eighteen large-scale post-carbon transition strategies, from government and non-government sources. it is informed by analysis of policies and reports identifying one or more integrated pathways for achieving dramatic greenhouse gas emissions reductions within national or supranational jurisdictions. for each strategy we considered assumptions and priorities regarding: targets, technology; economics and financing; equity; governance; and social and political change. we describe lessons from analysis of these attempts to articulate and stimulate integrated actions for post-carbon transitions and point to areas for further exploration. a crucial difference was identified between strategies advocating an incremental and evolutionary approach to emissions reductions and those advocating more rapid and transformational change. this highlights the challenging and urgent task of understanding how to bridge the gap between physical requirements of action to prevent runaway climate change and societal support for action at that speed and scale.\",\"local matters: political opportunities, spatial scale, and support for green jobs policies. research on the politics of sustainability transitions can benefit from more attention to the political opportunity structure and its variation at different levels of spatial scale. the study focuses on policy conflicts in the u.s. as represented in the media during the obama administration years of 2007\\u20132013, when the opportunity structure became increasingly closed. energy-transition policies were often framed as green jobs and green economic development to overcome opposition from regime actors and conservative politicians. we show that media reports of the policies at the national and global level are less positive than at the local and state-government level. furthermore, articles that quote from business leaders tend to be more positive. scalar variation in political opportunities is of general interest for the politics of transitions, especially in countries where conservative parties control national governments and oppose sustainability policy development.\",\"financing grassroots innovation diffusion pathways: the case of uk community energy. this paper explores how finance can better support the diffusion of grassroots innovations (gis), community-led solutions for net-zero transitions. we examine the case of uk community energy (ce), across three \\u2018diffusion pathways\\u2019: niche replication (growth in the number of projects), individual scaling (growth in an organisation's scale) and collective diffusion (a confederation of gis). we investigate each pathway through analysis of a nationwide survey, interviews and four case studies. we find that while finance currently supports replication of small-scale ce projects, the incompatibility between gis and the wider finance meta-regime inhibits individual scaling. the uk ce sector has responded with collective diffusion, via business group intermediaries; attracting greater but still insufficient finance. consequently, for gis to diffuse effectively, they must be supported to translate across both sectoral regimes (e.g. energy) and broader meta-regimes (e.g. finance). this paper contributes to theory on the role of finance in sociotechnical transitions and the role of intermediaries in gi

typology of intermediary organizations and their impact on sustainability transition policies. sustainability transitions encompass changes in existing socio-technological systems. in this context, scholars have emphasized the roles that intermediaries can play for sustainability transition. however, in the literature, the organizations or actors considered to act as intermediaries are very diverse and the concept of intermediary is used interchangeably between contexts. there is a risk that policy makers face difficulties understanding differences among intermediaries and consequently use some intermediaries for unfitting purposes. in this article, we propose to identify the similarities and differences among intermediaries, which are relevant for policy design for sustainability transitions. we base our comparison on three main characteristics: intermediaries\\u2019 source of funding, their scope of action and the target recipients of their services. our analysis indicates that these differences have an impact on intermediaries\\u2019 short-term or long-term orientation, actor-level or system-level focus, and demand-side or supply-side target. we end the article by discussing the implications for policy design.\",\"framing of regimes and transition strategies: an application to housing construction in denmark. this article suggests that transition strategies are always formulated in the context of specific representations of the regime and the challenges it faces. it is argued that the framing of a regime affects the envisioning of transition strategies. an analysis of the current development agenda for the housing construction sector in denmark reveals the relevance and impacts of different regime framings. it is proposed that the ability to cope with framing issues as situated and political processes is at the core of the governance of transitions.\",\"what's underneath? social skills throughout sustainability transitions. this paper focuses on the critical role of institutional entrepreneurs\\u2019 social skills in enabling transformative change as described by the multi-level perspective. understanding the role of social skills is crucial for developing a micro-foundational view of sustainability transitions. we develop an analytical framework using a multiple case study on swiss cantonal planners who acted as institutional entrepreneurs during comparable sustainability transitions by introducing sustainable planning practices within their cantons. we find seven applied skills (i) empathic, (ii) analytical, (iii) translational, (iv) framing, (v) tactical, (vi) organizational, and (vii) timing. four propositions discuss the role of these social skills across transition phases: from pre-development to take-off, from take-off to acceleration, and from acceleration to stabilization. we present conclusions and implications for future research on the micro-foundations of sustainability transitions.\",\"skills deployment for a \\u2018just\\u2019 net zero energy transition. a \\u2018just transition\\u2019 seeks to protect the rights of the workforce throughout transition away from high carbon industries and towards sustainable economic sectors. this includes reskilling where appropriate and a fair distribution of benefits, alongside recognition and participation of affected communities. drawing on a systematic literature review and a case study delineated by the 38 english local enterprise partnerships we analyse the variety of skills required to support a just transition to more decentralised and smart low carbon energy systems (defined as \\u2018smart local energy systems\\u2019) in england. we found that more attention is required in assessing skills provision, alongside upskilling the workforce, or risk the transition being unjust. regional disparities in skills availability could be mitigated through a local skills provision system whereby stakeholders can review training opportunities, identify emergent skill-gaps and leverage investment. in addition, greater devolution to local authorities would enable them to support stakeholders more effectively.\",\"let's focus more on negative trends: a comment on the transitions research agenda. much has been written on sustainability transitions, yet all around us unsustainable developments remain rife, and threaten to offset the progress made in other areas. this viewpoint argues that transitions scholarship should widen its scope to consider unsustainable trends, which it has tended to neglect to date. we argue that there is merit in applying the transitions lens to these developments, not least because of its systemic approach, which could help highlight the dynamic relationships between sustainable and unsustainable trends. we sketch some high-level questions for future transitions research including: how unsustainable trends emerge, who drives them, and how research could help to curtail harmful socio-technological changes before they become entrenched. we conclude by arguing that investigating unsustainable trends would benefit transitions research by making it more plural and more radical.\",\"tackling intersecting climate change and biodiversity emergencies: opportunities for sustainability transitions research. as transitions researchers consider the research needs and priorities for the next decade, environmental challenges are deepening to create complex sustainability issues. climate change and biodiversity conservation in particular are framed as intersecting emergencies. while transitions research can make significant contributions towards analysing and addressing these intersecting emergencies, an increased focus on transdisciplinarity and knowledge co-production, particularly through foregrounding indigenous peoples\\u2019 participation, is required to effectively encompass complex systems approaches, and to embed deep knowledge, experience, and stewardship in research design and application.\",\"a \\u2018correlative\\u2019 turn for transition studies on china. understanding china is critical to understanding global sustainability transitions. transitions theories within the anglophone academic tradition are limited in uncovering the deep mechanisms of china's transition dynamics. building upon chinese epistemologies, this viewpoint calls for a \\u2018correlative\\u2019 turn for transition studies on china for the next decade. through an illustrative case of entrepreneurial experimentation in china, we show how correlativeness is embedded in the logics of transition activities. a correlative epistemology might answer the important question of why transitions gain momentum in some places but not in others.\",\"governance strategies to enhance the adaptive capacity of niche experiments. calls for sustainability have resulted in the initiation of many system innovation projects. despite the existence of several theoretical frameworks and principles on the governance of these system innovation projects, managers and participants still all too often feel at a loss for practical tools and guidelines to bring the project forward. this suggests that the current literature does not effectively support managers and participants during the governance of system innovation projects. this article aims to reduce this apparent gap by developing a systematic framework, based on both literature and practice, allowing project managers to enhance the adaptive capacity of system innovation projects. we propose an emergent design approach focussing on three main concepts: diversity, alignment and knowledge generation, and operationalise this framework into a coherent set of strategies and tools.\",\"engaging with climate adaptation in transition studies. transitions studies has much to offer to the study of climate adaptation. while there are several factors that explain why climate adaptation has not been the subject of sustainable transitions research historically, the process of adapting to climate impacts is well-suited to the analytical frameworks developed in transitions studies. key areas where sustainable transitions research could contribute to adaptation include: the normative and directed nature of adaptation, cross-scalar politics associated with transformation, and the role of the private sector in adaptation. similarly, adaptation research can inform the understanding of the role of disturbance and disasters in transitions, and increase attention to vulnerabilities, inequality and uneven impacts of transitions. synergies between mitigation and adaptation, insights into the relationship between transitions and transformation, and just transitions are likely to be productive areas for collaborative engagement.\",\"the politics of deliberate destabilisation for sustainability transitions. this paper advances scholarship on deliberate destabilisation for sustainability transitions. to understand how deliberate destabilisation plays out in practice, the politics of such processes must be confronted. to this end, we bridge research on the political economy of sustainability transitions with recent theorisations of the deliberate destabilisation of unsustainable socio-technical regimes and propose a set of analytical dimensions and guiding questions for the study of the latter. the added value of a political economy perspective to understand the politics of deliberate destabilisation in capitalist economies is demonstrated through the historical example of the phase-out of hen battery cages in the netherlands. the poultry sector in the netherlands embodies an industrial approach to food and farming, orientated towards producing large amounts of standardised and cheap food. we foster new insights on the influence of intertwined political and economic interests for deliberate destabilisation processes, which may reproduce, rather than transform, unsustainable and unjust socio-technical regimes.\",\"remaking political institutions in sustainability transitions. a key challenge for sustainability transitions scholarship in the coming decade is to understand how existing political institutions (e.g. policies, laws, regulations, constitutions) can be remade to support transitions. this requires not only explaining past changes, but also \\u2018thinking forward\\u2019 about the types of struggles likely to occur when institutional changes are deliberately pursued. several areas of struggle come into view: the politics of novelty, uptake, dismantling, stability, and interplay across regimes. this leads to a view of institutional transformation as an unfolding trajectory \\u2018in-the-making\\u2019, characterized by emergent path creation. moreover, it enables new bridges from transitions thinking to broader political and policy sciences which also increasingly puzzle over how major societal change may be realized in contemporary society.\",\"curating complexity: an artful approach for real-world system transitions. this paper puts forward a \\u2018curatorial approach\\u2019 to systems transitions, which is a novel, practical and transparent way to deal with participation in complex and conflictual contexts. we argue that the complexity of transitions cannot be adequately addressed through traditional analytical tools. alternatively, we propose an approach that can engage with multiple ways of knowing and expression, sustaining and developing a sense of \\u2018meaning\\u2019 in the planning process. we situate this within a systems perspective that combines individual and structural actions for vision creation. this is explored in the case study of a large peri-urban asset in rome.\",\"policy mixes for sustainability transitions must embrace system dynamics. increasing the policy impact of sustainability transitions research requires a focus on the interactions and feedbacks within and between systems. more specifically, it requires insights into how dynamics can accelerate sustainability transitions and make them self-reinforcing. existing approaches that focus on dynamics lack a social-science perspective, often leading to an overestimation of policy leverage. sustainability transitions scholars are uniquely positioned to address this research gap. this requires the following steps: (1) the identification of those intervention points that set in motion reinforcing feedbacks or reduce negative interactions, (2) using a systems perspective to understand how trade-offs between different processes can be reduced and co-benefits stimulated, and (3) gathering empirical insights from the sustainability transitions research on how policy can trigger self-reinforcing dynamics.\",\"gender and transition in climate governance. this article demonstrates how gender is relevant to governance of a transition to a low-carbon economy. it does this through insights derived from gender and transition studies in combination, applied and illustrated through a study of climate governance in sweden. the approach is constructive and uses as central concepts: transition arenas, niches, regimes and landscapes in combination with theories from gender studies. the article suggests that the two fields are linked through three processes that are necessary to make a transition: to strengthen participation, to deal with oppressive power relations and to challenge institutionalized norms. it illustrates how masculine norms seem to permeate the landscape of climate transitions and argues that gender regimes tend to dictate planning, measures and implementation. finally, the article proposes that a gender perspective on climate governance would analyze participation in transition arenas and niches by asking who is included in climate governance and what ideas influence climate policies.\",\"engaging with changing spatial realities in tis research. highlights: the aim of this commentary is to discuss how to engage analytically with the changing spatial realities of clean-tech sectors and tis. the commentary argues for a situated rather than a descriptive notion of context in tis studies. the commentary suggests how concepts and mechanisms from economic geography can be incorporated into tis research.\",\"neglected systems and theorizing: a comment on the transitions research agenda. the new sustainability transitions research network agenda (k\\u00f6hler et al., 2019) is an ambitious attempt to establish the frontiers of transitions studies. in this comment i propose two ways to broaden it in terms of thematic focus and the role of theory.\",\"economic crisis, long waves and the sustainability transition: an african perspective. to make sense of the global crisis and a possible transition, many re-interpret the past as a set of successive long-term development cycles that could repeat in future. at the same time environmental pressures have resulted in the notion of a green economy. it is argued that the current global economic crisis simultaneously marks the end of the post-wwii long-term development cycle, the mid-point of the information age and potentially the start of a new era of sustainable development. it must be recognised that only certain futures are being imagined with africa's options largely ignored. as african growth rates rise as demand for its resources increase, it is necessary to question whether africa is appropriately positioned to take advantage of the next long-term development. the new discourse of 'resource nationalism' is promising, but only if governance modalities can be found that can transcend the resource curse.\",\"role of psychology in sociotechnical transitions studies: review in relation to consumption and technology acceptance. in the sustainability transitions literature, social phenomena have mostly been examined in relation to \\u2013 and at the level of \\u2013 collective forms of action. here our focus is on psychological, primarily individualistic approaches to understanding action as behaviour, with particular attention to consumption and technology acceptance. we document and discuss the ways in which the psychology of agents or actors has been described and theorised in these contexts within the sociotechnical transitions literature to date, both implicitly and explicitly. a review of the latter literature shows that while actor motivation and behaviour are often implicitly referred to, these are rarely theorised explicitly using psychological concepts. reasons for the limited use of individual-level, psychological constructs are discussed and suggestions for how these may be more closely connected to structural and collective processes are made.\",\"a transition to a denser and more sustainable city: factors and actors in trondheim, norway. this paper analyses urban densification in norway as a key element of sustainable city policies. the city is viewed as a system in which changes of material aspects, such as density, are linked with social and technological aspects. densification targets in trondheim are used as a case study to explore the main actors and factors involved in urban development. a multilevel perspective approach used in sustainability transitions studies is applied as a model to describe them. the aim is to illustrate interactions and barriers arising in the implementation of densification policies. the argument suggests that despite a shift of paradigm in planning towards sustainability, urban regimes have remained rather stable. some progress has been made, but further advancing the sustainability agenda may require new rules in the regime \\u2013 for example, new planning policies integrated with taxation and financial instruments, and transport regulations \\u2013 and a stronger emphasis on niche developments.\",\"sustainability-oriented labs in transitions: an empirically grounded typology. sustainability is high on the political agenda, with its analytical and practical importance underscored in the field of sustainability transitions. experiments, arenas, and laboratories are frequently highlighted as real-world objects to investigate sustainability in place. despite existing lab studies, attempts at comparison at the empirical level remain unconvincing. here, sustainability remains oversimplified, warranting further investigation to unpack how labs compare in their orientation towards sustainability. this article presents a rigorous and transparent empirically grounded typology, intended to discern ways to engage with sustainability. we outline and elaborate upon six distinctive types entitled: 1) fix and control, 2) (re-)design and optimize, 3) make and relate, 4) educate and engage, 5) empower and govern, and 6) explore and shape. this study highlights similarities and differences between labs, and across different types. these findings are discussed with reference to ongoing conceptualizations on directionality, providing a fruitful point of departure for ongoing transitions research.\",\"space and scale in socio-technical transitions. the multi-level perspective (mlp) is a widely adopted framework for analysing stability, change and transitions in socio-technical systems. key to explanations of change is the interaction between nested levels (niche, regime, landscape) constituting socio-technical systems over time. this paper proposes a second generation, multi-scalar mlp that explicitly incorporates a spatial scale. recent developments in innovation studies and contributions from regional studies and geography are reviewed. we draw on notions of space as being relational, fluid and contested by institutionally situated actors. dynamics in socio-technical systems are explained not only by interactions between modes of structuration and developments over time, but also by interactions between actors and institutions situated across different levels of spatial scale. the paper explores the kinds of insights that might emerge from adopting a second generation mlp to socio-technical systems with a case study of biomass gasification in india.\",\"introduction to \\u201czooming in and out: special issue on local transition governance\\u201d. transitions research has paid increasing attention to the different spatial scales of transitions. this special section considers whether fundamental changes in structures, cultures and practices can be addressed at local or district scales. this focus on local scales also draws the attention to different types of local actors, their roles, activities, networks and interactions. conceptual papers develop typologies addressing the dynamics of local transitions and suggest strategies for making transitions last. it is argued that local governance has limited personnel and financial resources to support transitions. network development is one strategy for addressing this. case studies confirm that local context is important in understanding transitions processes, along with their relationships to higher levels of governance.\",\"mining\\u2014the dark side of the energy transition. the energy transition will significantly increase demand for minerals. this might create new economic opportunities for lower-income countries with resources, but it will also augment local social and environmental problems associated with the sector. the increasing number of social and environmental conflicts associated with mining in emerging economies is a manifestation of this tension and raises questions about just energy transitions. but can mining be done in more sustainable ways? transition studies have been largely silent on this question. in this article, we urge transitions scholars to incorporate mining into their analyses of energy transitions and briefly mention possible starting points to move in this direction.\",\"axes of contestation in sustainability transitions. research in sustainability transitions increasingly acknowledges that the structural characteristics of socio-technical systems differ. however, little attention has been paid to the specific transition dynamics that can result from this structural variation. in response, this paper develops a framework for studying transition dynamics that takes the structural characteristics of socio-technical systems and their influence on agency into account. we introduce the concept contestation axis to highlight alternative potential interfaces between functional solutions in a socio-technical system. we argue that considerable agency and frictions between actors can play out at other axes than between established regimes and emerging niches. our conceptual framework is applied to a case study in the waste sector. we explore how the growing influence of the circular economy triggers misalignment between multiple socio-technical configurations in the danish waste sector. in the case, we zoom in on three actual frictions that have manifested along different contestation axes.\",\"households in sustainability transitions: a systematic review and new research avenues. this paper explores conceptualisations of households in sustainability transitions. existing literature in the field has only engaged with households in a limited and fragmented way, despite the role of households in resource use, shaping social innovation and as a target of environmental policies. the paper asks: how are households conceptualised in sustainability transitions and how could this be further developed in future research? the paper uses systematic review to explore how the literature currently engages with households. we find two overarching approaches to households: a closed-box approach and an open-box approach. the closed-box approach engages households as a fixed unit of analysis, without attention to internal dynamics and how these may interact with system-level changes, whereas the open-box approach unpacks the household as a dynamic social unit and material setting in the context of multiple scales and other social units. both approaches are further discussed in terms of how they engage with households as users, sites and sources. based on the analysis, the paper proposes a comprehensive definition of households in transition studies, and identifies four areas for future research in sustainability transitions: households' and householders\\u2019 agency; unpacking household dynamics; household innovation across scales and socio-technical systems; and households in policy and governance.\",\"a heuristic for conceptualizing and uncovering the determinants of agency in socio-technical transitions. there has been a growing interest in transition studies on the role of agency in bringing about disruptive change. previous studies have examined how actors perform institutional work to create legitimacy and transform institutions. in doing so, they have provided insights into specific practices and strategies that actors follow. this paper seeks to complement existing studies by elucidating the foundations of agency that transforms institutions through institutional work. drawing on institutional sociology and organizational studies, resources, discourses and networks of actors are identified as key elements enabling institutional work practices. the agency of each actor is conceived of as dependent on the configurations it possesses with respect to these elements. a heuristic is presented that helps to determine the configurations associated with a strong agency in empirical settings and use swiss waste management as an illustrative case example. the heuristic enables a systematic analysis of agency across different organizational fields.\",\"use of fuzzy cognitive maps to study urban resilience and transformation. transformative change for urban sustainability and resilience calls for the use of new governance approaches that take into account the complexity of urban systems and associated stakeholder knowledge and perceptions. this raises the need to explore the cognitive dimension in the management of urban resilience and transformation. the article presents a fuzzy cognitive mapping approach to develop plausible policy scenarios that support the decarbonisation of the urban energy system of the city of bilbao, basque country. scenario results indicate that a combination of local institutional and social action may be most conducive for stimulating effective and sustainable transformation of bilbao's urban energy system. we address the properties of the resulting cognitive network, with a focus on the role of the energy system's connectivity which is found to present conflicting potential for resilience and transformation.\",\"institutional capacity to integrate \\u2018radical\\u2019 perspectives on sustainability in small municipalities: experiences from sweden. this study explores the local municipality as an important arena for developing and implementing initiatives for a transition to long-term sustainable development. it focuses on institutional conditions that support the integration of \\u2018radical\\u2019, transition-oriented perspectives and ideas (i.e. perspectives stressing the need for changed social power relations and \\u2018other\\u2019 norms and visions for the future,) in local governance, with a specific focus on small municipalities. inspired by transition literature and theory on institutional capacity, the paper explores frames of reference, relational resources, and mobilisation capacity. empirically, the paper builds on research in two small municipalities in sweden, where we studied documents on policy for local development, and energy and land-use planning, and carried out qualitative interviews with politicians, planners, and actors from local industry and civil society. the study provides a rich empirical illustration of specific conditions that affect the possibilities to work with transition-oriented perspectives in small municipalities.\",\"unpacking landscape pressures on socio-technical regimes: insights on the urban waste management system. in the last decades, the problem of waste management has gained momentum because of its associated environmental and health risks. this fosters a paradigm shift towards more sustainable regimes. this paper assesses the sources of pressure at the landscape level that are able to trigger a transition towards a sustainable innovative waste-management system. the paper carries out (i) a stakeholder's analysis, aimed at identifying the key stakeholders acting at the socio-technical landscape; and (ii) an assessment of sources of pressure, which explores economic and political pressures exerted at both local and global levels. our findings suggest that the transition towards a sustainable waste-management regime is associated with a \\u2018combined pressure mechanism\\u2019, which is based on the concerted action of different actors. in particular, it was observed that the combination of economic and political pressure triggered a competition/imitation mechanism among the receivers, activating a web of indirect sources of pressure.\",\"sustainable urban development and the multi-level transition perspective. this article discusses some challenges and possible adaptations of transition theory as a framework for analyzing the prospects for environmentally more sustainable development of urban land use and transport infrastructure. rather than depending first and foremost on niche innovations, a transition toward sustainable urban development is a matter of changing the composition of existing multi-segmented land use and transportation regimes. those well-experienced forms of built environment and transport infrastructure that are in line with sustainability objectives should be strengthened while those that are not should be actively constrained and reduced. urban development in a danish provincial city is used as a case to illustrate some of the points made in the theoretical part of the article. due to the wide gap between present conditions and those required to realize a sustainable urban development, more attention should be directed toward landscape level conditions and possibilities for changing them.\",\"behaviour in sustainability transitions: a mixed methods literature review. sustainability transitions require changing many behaviours embedded in production and consumption systems. simultaneously, behavioural public policy is now a significant site of research-policy translation globally. links between behaviour and system change are underdeveloped in both fields. systematic review of current transitions literature found \\u223c4% of papers focused on behaviour. two prominent perspectives on behaviour (labelled: \\u2018everyday\\u2019 and \\u2018strategic\\u2019) are critical of a focus on individuals, preferencing broader analysis. two additional perspectives were identified - \\u2018automatic\\u2019 and \\u2018reflective\\u2019 - which highlight immediate and local influences on behaviour but underemphasise context. all four perspectives on behaviour draw on different conceptualisations, causality, methods and disciplinary foundations, and yet all have value and application to transitions. we argue that a complimentary and flexible approach to behaviour would benefit the field, considering the diversity of phases, scales and contexts of sustainability transitions. transitions\\u2019 own behavioural perspectives could also help address behavioural public policy's challenges.\",\"intermediating policy for transitions towards net-zero energy buildings. the roles of intermediaries in sustainability transitions are increasingly recognised. how intermediaries advance transitions vis-a-vis public policy has, however, received little attention. thus, we create an analytical framework of intermediating policy processes, drawing from transition and policy cycle literatures. we apply this to investigate two policy processes pertaining to finland's building energy efficiency. the findings show how the central role of the ministry of the environment and high political attention have reduced the need for intermediation by external organisations in agenda setting and policy formulation. however, intermediaries external to the ministry have been vital in facilitating policy implementation. the cases show that facilitating training as an intermediary activity can be undertaken by different organisations, such as a trade union, a government agency or an education committee. based on our analysis, we argue that, when political attention on transitions is low, the need for intermediary action is likely to be higher.\",\"policy entrepreneurs in green building transitions: the role of interurban coalitions. this research examines the composition and operation of a multi-scalar, inter-urban coalition in israel's unfolding green building transition. using the multi-level perspective as an analytical framework, this research draws on concepts from policy entrepreneurship to flesh out the role of the city and city networks in transition activity. it examines how an entrepreneurial coalition of cities \\u2013 the forum 15 \\u2013 that sits both within and without the sociotechnical building regime facilitated the agency of regime members to engender a transition. we use chiefly qualitative research methods, specifically, semi-structured interviews and policy document analysis, to examine the critical function of an inter-urban coalition of 15 fiscally independent municipalities in leveraging its independence and resources to induce a national green building regime transformation. we suggest that combining the multi-level perspective with insights from entrepreneurial governance lends insight into the potential role of the city and its multi-scalar linkages in engendering a transition.\",\"gender in sustainability transition studies: concepts, blind spots and future orientations. gender is a vital factor of societal organisation and transformation, and figures prominently in global sustainability agendas. its social construction and interaction with technological change have been studied extensively. within the field of sustainability transition (st) research, however, the complex roles gender plays in socio-technical change are still rarely addressed or conceptualised. based on a systematic review covering scientific publications from 2010 to 2020 we illustrate this overall gap and explore how gender is operationalised. we draw on harding's notion of gender as structural, symbolic and behavioural expression to consider implications for understanding regimes, niches, and regime/niche interactions. our results recognise a variety of conceptual approaches accounting for the diverse implications of gender relations for transition dynamics and their sustainability orientation. in conclusion we recognise the usefulness of the suggested analytical lens for strengthening gender-sensitive inter- and transdisciplinary st research systematically, and suggest promising avenues for future studies.\",\"forever stuck in old ways? pluralising incumbencies in sustainability transitions. in this viewpoint, we argue that transitions research needs to engage more firmly with the role of incumbents and various forms of incumbencies. we identify shortcomings of existing research, notably a tendency to portray incumbents as \\u2018villains\\u2019 wedded to resisting, slowing down or preventing transition efforts. with that in mind, the viewpoint briefly summarises shortcomings within existing research and proposes four steps for pluralising the discussion. we call attention to more emphasis on 1) a multiplicity of incumbent actor types, 2) a variety of actor strategies within (and across) organisational populations, 3) the transient nature of strategic positioning (over time), and 4) the varied resources that incumbents may deploy to support transformative change.\",\"the policing of community gardening in rome. the aim of the paper is to show the inherent ambivalence of the relationship between policy-making and grassroots urban gardening initiatives. the voluntarism, variety and multiple meanings of community gardening, it is argued, is hardly compatible with the regulatory anxiety and isomorphic pressures that most policy schemes imply. the regulation of community gardening, in this frame, is very often caught in a delicate balance of promotion and control, co-optation and \\u201cpolicing\\u201d and risks to exacerbate already existing distinctions between collaborative and confrontational initiatives. we believe that addressing this ambivalence is crucial to a proper understanding of the socio-political meaning of community gardening, and of the problematic relationship between communities\\u2019 self-organization, sustainable transitions, and urban governance in an age of austerity and neoliberalism. the topic is addressed with reference to the city of rome, italy, in light of a recently approved regulation for community gardening.\",\"sustainability transitions and the state. sustainability transitions is an emerging field of research that has produced both conceptual understandings of the drivers of technological transitions, as well as more prescriptive and policy-engaged analyses of how shifts from unsustainable to sustainable forms of production and consumption can be achieved. yet attention towards the role of the state is underdeveloped in the field. the significance of this neglect has become more apparent in particular due to the heightened urgency around the need to tackle climate change and energy security, where there are increasing calls for an enhanced role for the state. this paper sets out to advance understandings of the multiple and conflicting roles that states play in transitions. it first addresses key weaknesses in the way the state has been examined thus far. second, it highlights theoretical resources and conceptualisations of the state that can help scholars of transitions open up new and more productive avenues for understanding drivers and barriers to sustainable transitions drawing on examples from different sectors, regions and issue areas.\",\"success factors and strategies for sustainability transitions of small-scale communities - evidence from a cross-case analysis. initiatives pursuing sustainability transitions of small-scale communities offer rich learning opportunities on: to what extent they are making progress toward sustainability; what success depends on; and how success can be replicated in other communities. yet, there is little empirical research addressing these questions. this article presents a cross-case analysis of sustainability transition initiatives in four small u.k. communities that tentatively identifies factors influencing transition outcomes as well as strategies to improve transition effectiveness. our findings suggest a wide range of factors to be important including socio-demographics, community governance, community capacity, organization and management, resources, and mobilization. the article demonstrates how empirical studies of this nature can successively build a broad knowledge base to support effective community transition practices.\",\"beyond deconstruction. a reconstructive perspective on sustainability transition governance. this paper reviews criticisms of sustainability transition studies, using transition management (tm) as a case study. while these criticisms have yielded theoretical progress, underlying epistemological issues remain. contrasting the tm approach to complexity with other more deconstructive views on complexity, it becomes clear that some criticisms on tm are inherently based on a deconstructive questioning of whether complex systems can be influenced into a desired direction. the authors build on those critiques to argue that tm needs to clarify how (1) tm itself harbours deconstructive power (hitherto insufficiently specified), while (2) at the same time having an explicit ambition to \\u2018go beyond\\u2019 deconstruction. to that end, this paper proposes a \\u2018reconstructive approach\\u2019 as an epistemological grounding for transition studies. this reconstructive approach is elaborated on three grounds: (1) a research focus beyond \\u2018is\\u2019 versus \\u2018ought\\u2019 towards \\u2018can be\\u2019, (2) interpretative research and reflexivity, and (3) a \\u2018phronetic\\u2019 understanding of sustainability.\",\"navigating institutional complexity in socio-technical transitions. transitions from one socio-technical regime configuration to another entail long phases of institutional complexity, where two or more field logics co-exist in a sector and induce incompatibilities and frictions. this paper presents a dynamic phase model, which characterizes the types of institutional complexity that may build up and settle across various phases of a transition, illustrated with a case study from the diffusion of onsite water reuse in san francisco. results from semi-structured expert interviews and a focus group demonstrate that different forms of institutional complexity may follow each other in a transition trajectory and that formidable strategic agency is needed by the actors in a field in navigating prolonged phases of competing cultural demands. gaining a more balanced perspective of both organizational and field-level reconfigurations may help better explain why transitions succeed in some places and fail in others.\",\"from leadership to followership: a suggestion for interdisciplinary theorising of mainstream actor reorientation in sustainability transitions. this viewpoint article draws attention to the importance of mainstream actor reorientation in the diffusion phase of sustainability transitions. it proposes an integrative typology of seminal social science theories, which distinguishes different depths of reorientation and associated processes.\",\"the spatial dynamics of deep transitions. industrial societies are currently evolving along a fundamentally unsustainable trajectory, contributing to climate change, resource depletion and loss of biodiversity. a recent deep transitions framework (schot and kanger, 2018; kanger and schot, 2019) argues that this trajectory has been built up through the first deep transition: a 250-year co-evolution of multiple socio-technical systems. however, to date the deep transitions framework has completely neglected the spatial dimension of this process. this makes it unable to explain (1) how socio-technical systems emerge in, gravitate towards, become linked in and disperse from certain locations; (2) how global constraints condition actors' responses in specific locations and how these responses, in turn, reproduce or transform socio-technical systems; (3) how these processes accumulate into socio-material landscapes, posing locationally varying constraints to major transformative change. as a response this paper aims to develop a middle-range theory of the spatial dynamics of deep transitions. synthesizing insights from a broad range of fields nine propositions are developed on the spatial patterns and mechanisms of long-term multi-system co-evolution. the resulting framework enables to explain the spatial genesis of the first deep transition and opens up a research agenda for studying the possibly emerging second deep transition.\",\"on patterns and agency in transition dynamics: some key insights from the ksi programme. the transition perspective on promoting sustainable development recognizes a need for not merely new societal practices, but changes in the structures in which these practices are embedded, and which have co-evolved with earlier practices ('the regime'). this article presents insights on the dynamics of sustainable transitions, developed within the context of the dutch ksi programme, and identifies issues for further research. two perspectives, the sociotechnical approach and the complex adaptive systems approach, have yielded typologies of transition trajectories. we discuss similarities of, and differences between, these. third, the governance perspective has generated insights about the agency involved, including powering and legitimization. while the latter offers some response to scholarly criticism that earlier transition theory too much ignored aspects of power and legitimacy, more research is obviously needed.\",\"elite vs. mass politics of sustainability transitions. while the past decade of transitions scholarship has increasingly acknowledged the centrality of politics, key questions on transition politics deserve further research. here, we develop a heuristic framework from the discipline of political science that separates transition politics into the classic categories of interests, ideas, institutions, as well as elite and mass politics. based on this framework, we conduct a review of existing transitions literature on politics. we find that some areas of our framework are better covered than others. for instance, while the institutional foundations of elite politics are relatively well researched, there are only few studies on interests and ideas in mass politics. in geographical and sectoral terms, research is biased toward energy transitions in europe and north america. based on our review, we map areas for future research we believe to be indispensable to better understand varieties of transition politics.\",\"policy entrepreneurs in sustainability transitions: their personality and leadership profiles assessed. this article describes the theoretical development and empirical evaluation of an instrument to assess the personality and leadership profiles of policy entrepreneurs in sustainability transitions. using insights from psychology and leadership theory, the study aims to identify personality and leadership characteristics that predispose an individual's involvement in policy entrepreneurship. the instrument was evaluated by comparing the personality characteristics of a group of policy entrepreneurs working on sustainability transitions in the field of health care, water management and regional development with a group of policy professionals involved in related policy fields. the distinct personality and leadership profiles found for these groups supports the validity of the assessment instrument. the instrument paves the way for more comprehensive research into the relation between personality structure, contextual variables and entrepreneurial behaviour and success.\",\"assessing change agency in urban experiments for sustainability transitions. experimentation has become one of the prevailing modes of governing the transition toward sustainable practices in urban environments. the spatial variation of urban sustainability transition has been attributed to a variety of conditions erected at different spatial scales. what remains less well-understood is how spatial situatedness shapes agency in urban experiments and the shapes agency can take is a field that requires further research and frameworks. the paper addresses this gap by introducing a framework from the literature on regional development, identifying three distinct types of agency that shape regional development processes. combining this framework with a process perspective on urban experiments, we develop an analytical framework, which allows for a more granular understanding of agency in urban sustainability transitions. the analytical framework is then brought to use in a case study of an urban experiment aiming to electrify public transport in gothenburg, sweden.\",\"legitimizing transformative government: aligning essential government tasks from transition literature with normative arguments about legitimacy from public administration traditions. the literature on transitions recommends that both the government and the civil service should engage with profound societal problems requiring a fundamental socio-technical system change. we analyzed a corpus of 100 publications to cluster the transition tasks that the transitions literature attributes to government. these tasks are set off against the normative arguments of the public administration (pa) traditions that legitimize government action. our analysis shows that although some traditions present a normative basis for specific tasks, many of the transition tasks assigned to government do not align well with any of the pa traditions. thus, the normative basis for legitimizing sociotechnical transitions provided by the pa traditions, is inadequate. this finding is consistent with the recently flagged urgent need for a new, legitimizing rationale for societal transition. we conclude by presenting the contours of transformative government as a new pa tradition to legitimize the government' s transition tasks.\",\"mixed feelings: a review and research agenda for emotions in sustainability transitions. low-carbon transitions across energy and transport systems have been widely researched in regards to how transitions are designed, what policies support them, which technologies they entail, and how fast, or slow, they take. much of this research has focused on examining the agency and behavior of actors and institutions, or examining processes and outcomes, but less weight has been given to human emotions. based on an explorative systematic review of the sustainability transitions literature, we address a research gap by focusing on how emotions have been reported or examined in transitions concerning energy, buildings and transport. we show that the acceptability and adaptation of new technologies, systems, policies and practices requires people's willingness to change, which itself needs positive emotional commitment. we thus propose a new research agenda for low-carbon transitions that takes into consideration people's emotions as we address climate change and attempt to move to net zero societies.\",\"examining outlooks on sustainability transitions through computational language analysis. this viewpoint exemplifies how advances in computational text analysis allow for analysing novel data for transitions studies. applying the specific technique of topic modelling to plenary talks related to energy in the finnish parliament during 2008\\u20132020 illustrates how the approach can be of use to transitions studies. in particular, it aids in exploring the dynamics of diverging perspectives, such as by right-wing populists and the greens, on outlooks for energy transitions. we sketch how computational text analysis can further contribute to transitions studies.\",\"a field perspective on sustainability transitions: the case of religious organizations. this article proposes the field perspective as an approach to explain organizational activities in sustainability transitions. it applies this framework to analyze environmental activities of religious organizations in germany and switzerland. religious organizations can become important actors in transitions by drawing on their extensive membership, material resources, and public visibility. however, to date, research is dearth about the conditions that facilitate transition activities of religious organizations. the empirical insights of this study show differences in the activities (a) between religious incumbents and challengers and (b) between the supra-local and local scale. the field perspective allows for explaining these differences as outcomes of the organizations\\u2019 power positions and diverging institutional logics on the supra-local and local scale. rather than religious beliefs, the interplay of power and scale-specific logics shapes activities of religious organizations.\",\"fostering learning beyond urban experiment boundaries. urban experimentation has been increasingly applied as a tool for finding new ways to face grand societal and environmental challenges. social learning and reflectivity that urban experiments might trigger are seen as crucial mechanisms in this process. nevertheless, it often remains unclear how to concretely enable learning in urban experimentation. in order to address this practice and knowledge gap, an experiential learning and transition strategy (elts) was developed and applied to the dutch mobile city experiments program (ims). its main aim was to foster learning within and beyond the experiment program boundaries. applying and assessing elts to ims gave a clearer idea of what works (e.g., the use of learning exercises or guiding questions, stimulating \\u201cself-learning,\\u201d strong moderation, enough time, and a diverse group of participants), and what does not work (e.g., input from individual experts), when organizing learning events related to urban experimentation.\",\"regime pressures and organizational forms of community-based sustainability initiatives. we explore how applying for and maintaining a legal form of organization exposes community-based initiatives (cbis) to pressures with the potential to shape them. using grounded theory and the multi-level perspective, we found that there are two types of pressures through which regimes influence cbis associated with legal forms of organization: resource dependence and coercive isomorphism. these pressures come in the form of barriers which push and prevent cbis in the process of acquiring and maintaining a legal organizational form. cbis resist and work to overcome the pressures using social capital, internal agreements, citizen financing, and umbrella organizations. this knowledge contributes to the understanding of how regimes resist and create barriers to innovations, how cbis cope with this regime resistance, and has implications for the design of instruments for purposeful transitions.\",\"international organisations in global sustainability transitions. this viewpoint identifies two widely neglected parallels between scholarship on international organisations (ios) and sustainability transitions research. we contend that io scholarship can push sustainability transitions research along these two parallels by elaborating on ios as global sustainability actors. specifically, io research offers not only a fuller understanding of the transnational dynamics of incumbency but also a more nuanced understanding of non-incumbent actor roles. in the next decade, scholars working on sustainability transitions and those studying ios should thus join forces to examine how powerful transnational actors shape processes of transformative global change.\",\"remaking the material fabric of the city: 'alternative' low carbon spaces of transformation or continuity?. this article is about re-making the material fabric of the city and the role that space plays in this. there are many ways of understanding the remaking of the city, including a range of often diverse 'alternative' initiatives which are enacted by neighbourhood, voluntary and civil society groups. we address the construction of 'alternative' urban low carbon spaces and whether these result in transformation of or continuity with dominant ways of thinking about remaking the city. drawing on examples in greater manchester, uk, the article argues that, often despite the intention to promote forms of localist values and strategies as alternatives to dominant accounts of remaking the city, the hand of dominant and particularly state interests is critical in shaping 'alternative' spaces and strategies. this tension - between dominant and alternative - is illustrated through a five-fold typology of the role of space in alternative strategies of remaking the city.\",\"moving beyond disruptive innovation: a review of disruption in sustainability transitions. because of the urgency of accelerating transitions, we examine the emerging understanding of the concept of \\u2018disruption\\u2019 in the context of sustainability transition studies to critically assess its value, pitfalls and potentials. by conducting a qualitative systematic review of 47 articles, we analyse how disruption is seen in this literature and what is being disrupted. we identify four non-technical dimensions of disruption, adding \\u2018behaviour, practices and cultural models\\u2019 to previously suggested dimensions, i.e., markets and business models, regulations and policy, and actors and networks. we summarise what the literature identifies as disruption in transitions and draw on other literatures (e.g. social practice theory and institutional theory) to elaborate the dimensions of disruption. we provide a new definition of disruption in sociotechnical transitions, with focus on both speed and magnitude of change. we end by highlighting the importance of disruptive practices and low-tech solutions alongside disruptive technologies and policies.\",\"transition versus transformation: what's the difference?. \\u2018transition\\u2019 and \\u2018transformation\\u2019 have become buzzwords in political and scientific discourses. they signal the need for large-scale changes to achieve a sustainable society. we compare how they are applied and interpreted in scientific literatures to explore whether they are distinct concepts and provide complementary insights. transition and transformation are not mutually exclusive; they provide nuanced perspectives on how to describe, interpret and support desirable radical and non-linear societal change. their differences may partially result from their etymological origins, but they largely stem from the different research communities concerned with either transition or transformation. our review shows how the respective approaches and perspectives on understanding and interpreting system change can enrich each other.\",\"\\u201cit's not talked about\\u201d: the risk of failure in practice in sustainability experiments. scholars of sustainability transition have given much attention to local experiments in \\u2018protected spaces\\u2019 where system innovations can be initiated and where learning about those innovations can occur. however, local project participants\\u2019 conceptions of success are often different to those of transition scholars; where scholars see a successful learning experience, participants may see a project which has failed to \\u201cdeliver\\u201d. this research looks at two uk case studies of energy retrofit projects \\u2013 birmingham energy savers and warm up north, both in the uk, and the opportunities they had for learning. the findings suggest that perceptions of failure and external real world factors reducing the capacity to experiment, meant that opportunities for learning were not well capitalised upon. this research makes a contribution to the sustainability transitions literature which has been criticised for focusing predominantly on successful innovation, and not on the impact of failure.\",\"reflections on editing eist for ten years. this \\u2018farewell editorial\\u2019 looks back at a ten-year period of serving as founding editor-in-chief of eist. it shares some personal experiences as well as thoughts about content and style.\",\"nurturing nature: exploring socio-spatial conditions for urban experimentation. cities are critical places for the emergence of sustainability transitions. the early phases of transition are often characterised by experimentation. socio-spatial conditions, such as local policy, governance networks, localised learning and funding structures, are known to influence experimentation, yet there is little empirical knowledge on how these conditions contribute. we construct a framework to analyse how these conditions coincide with patterns in urban experimentation, distinguishing between incremental and radical experimentation and between social, technological, and systemic experiments. we introduce a method for large-n analysis and apply this to a database of 520 nbs in 100 european cities. this creates detailed insights into which socio-spatial conditions are associated with particular types of experimentation and how this relates to the urban innovative environment. empirically, this paper focuses on \\u2018nature-based solutions\\u2019 (nbs), which is an emerging concept for the innovative use of nature to address societal challenges.\",\"analyzing a transition to a sustainability-oriented science system in germany. the multi-level perspective has successfully been applied to the analysis of complex sector transitions in the energy, the health or the food production sector. is this framework also helpful to understand and give prescriptive advice for sustainability transformations within a national science system? based on a comprehensive study of the diffusion of transdisciplinary sustainability research in germany, this article analyzes the institutional dimension of a changing science-society relation in the german science system. it uses the multi-level perspective as a fruitful heuristic in order to identify potential pathways for a broader diffusion of transdisciplinary sustainability science. the importance of niche coalitions of frontrunner universities and research institutes are highlighted.\",\"engaging with the politics of sustainability transitions. although recent scholarship has contributed to our understanding of sustainability transitions, more needs to be done to grasp the politics of these processes. what works and what does not work is being sorted out in the world of practical politics. but social science could contribute by drawing lessons from political experience and offering theoretical insights.\",\"the dynamics of consumer behavior and the transition to sustainable consumption patterns. strong growth in disposable income has driven, and is still driving, consumption to unprecedented, but not sustainable levels. to explain the dynamic interplay of needs, need satisfaction, and innovation underlying that growth a behavioral theory of consumption is suggested and discussed with respect to its implications for making a transition to more sustainable patterns of consumer behavior.\",\"actor roles in transition: insights from sociological perspectives. to date, the field of transition research lacks a suitable vocabulary to analyse the (changing) interactions and relations of actors as part of a sustainability transition. this article addresses this knowledge gap by exploring the potential of the concept of \\u2018roles\\u2019 from social interaction research. the role concept is operationalized for transition research to allow the analysis of (changing) roles and relations between actor roles as indicative of changes in the social fabric and shared values, norms and beliefs. it also allows considering the use of roles as a transition governance intervention. this includes creating new roles, breaking down or altering existing ones and explicitly negotiating or purposefully assigning roles, as well as the flexible use of roles as resources.\",\"mobility protests in the netherlands of the 1970s: activism, innovation, and transitions. with the netherlands having the world's highest cycling rates, many see its current cycling policies as a model for the transition to sustainable transportation systems. understanding these high cycling rates, however, requires understanding the geographic, historical, and institutional context in which social movements, working with government actors, helped stop a rapid decline in cycling rates between the 1950s and the 1970s in the netherlands. this article uses historical sources and interviews with activists and government actors to show how social movements supported cycling by helping reverse the negative effects of rapid motorization. these social movements worked with government actors to implement three specific innovations: the woonerf, the bottleneck memorandum, and the car-restricted city center. this article contributes to transitions literature by looking beyond the relationship between enterprise and the state and demonstrating how social movements within a specific institutional context and with broad public support can advance sustainable transportation innovations.\",\"transition in south african water governance: insights from a perspective on power. after apartheid, south africa has stepped up to the challenge of reforming an inequitable water service delivery system to meet the needs of all citizens. we frame this systematic societal change as a transition in water governance. we argue that when evaluating this pathway of transition, we should not only look at the changes in water legislation and number with improved access, but also analyze the quality of the water service delivery in terms of different payment schemes, participation by local citizens and conflicts around equality of water provision. by analyzing power in transition studies, we explore the power dynamics at play in two regions of johannesburg, namely alexandra and soweto. the paper highlights the need to explicate the politics of water service delivery and suggests opportunities to break the negative patterns in order to achieve equitable and sustainable water service delivery in south africa.\",\"sustainability transitions and strategic action fields: a literature review and discussion. with the growing attention to political dimensions of sustainability transitions (sts), researchers have shown interest in theoretical frameworks from policy studies and sociology. a framework that has growing popularity is the theory of strategic action fields (saf) as developed by fligstein and mcadam (2011; 2012). this review shows 1) how the integrated and holistic approach of saf theory can contribute to growing interest in st research in institutions, power, and agency; and 2) how st researchers have modified and extended saf theory. based on a systematic sample of publications, the study identifies five theoretical clusters of saf theory in st research: actor relations and resources; change, emergence, and destabilization of fields; field rules; agency, framing, and coalitions; and strategic action in an interfield matrix. the potential of field theory as an analytical framework for st research is discussed and critically assessed.\",\"productivity growth as a barrier to a sustainability transition. the need for strong productivity growth is a prominent feature of economic policy debates in australia. using the productivity trap concept, this viewpoint explores how in some circumstances the pursuit of productivity growth is a barrier to effective sustainability transitions. this is illustrated by a case study of the australian baking industry, where the increased market share of small-scale artisan bakers vis-\\u00e0-vis industrial bakers has recently led to an overall decline in productivity across the baking sector. although artisan bakers produce more nutritious products and have the potential to significantly increase the energy efficiency of their operations, their labour productivity is half that of their industrial counterparts. whilst this is good for employment, public health and the environment, artisan bakers have been denigrated as a \\u2018drain on productivity\\u2019. this case study illustrates the potential role of low-productivity goods and services in a sustainability transition in australia and other developed countries.\",\"an agenda for sustainability transitions research: state of the art and future directions. research on sustainability transitions has expanded rapidly in the last ten years, diversified in terms of topics and geographical applications, and deepened with respect to theories and methods. this article provides an extensive review and an updated research agenda for the field, classified into nine main themes: understanding transitions; power, agency and politics; governing transitions; civil society, culture and social movements; businesses and industries; transitions in practice and everyday life; geography of transitions; ethical aspects; and methodologies. the review shows that the scope of sustainability transitions research has broadened and connections to established disciplines have grown stronger. at the same time, we see that the grand challenges related to sustainability remain unsolved, calling for continued efforts and an acceleration of ongoing transitions. transition studies can play a key role in this regard by creating new perspectives, approaches and understanding and helping to move society in the direction of sustainability.\",\"what sticks? ephemerality, permanence and local transition pathways. climate change is increasingly governed through local configurations that are characterised by voluntary action, weak institutions and uncoordinated efforts. the impermanent and iterative nature of such initiatives makes it difficult to determine their enduring and potentially transformative impact. this review systematises how the sustainability transitions field has approached temporary initiatives. it finds broad agreement on the difficulty of sustaining local transitions, but little analytical engagement with how temporary initiatives shape transition pathways over time. the review therefore proposes a typology of temporal dimensions to help assess the dynamics between ephemerality and permanence in local transitions. by mapping the recent empirical sustainability transitions literature along these dimensions, ephemerality is found to be ubiquitous in local initiatives\\u2013there is a lot happening that does not endure but serves other functions. actors deploy a range of local strategies directed at either formalising initiatives or retaining relevance by reinventing themselves, thus routinising sustainability transitions.\",\"towards sustainability in the port sector: the role of intermediation in transition work. intermediation has received substantial attention from transition scholars. intermediaries play important roles in configuring, brokering, and facilitating transition efforts and operate in different parts of socio-technical systems. their node position between transport and energy systems makes port authorities a potentially crucial intermediary in transitioning the many different sectors that intersect in ports. ports are increasingly orienting their environmental endeavours towards energy issues and are pressured to reduce their global emissions. this paper explores intermediation in ports and investigates how intermediation connects to transition work. based on a quantitative survey among 96 norwegian ports, we find that ports engage in intermediation to varying extent, and that intermediation is associated with progressive transition work. the study complements previous research on intermediaries by conceptualising and quantitatively measuring transition work, allowing us to explore in what ways ports rely on intermediation in their sustainability endeavours.\",\"the socio-spatial politics of urban sustainability transitions: grassroots initiatives in gentrifying peckham. this paper examines how grassroots sustainability initiatives take shape in a specific socio-economic context. it argues that such initiatives are best conceived of as exercises in material, socio-cultural, and political-economic \\u2018placemaking\\u2019 which is especially evident in the gentrifying urban environment. a gentrification perspective highlights the ways in which initiatives are influenced by their local socio-economic milieux and, vice versa, can influence the socio-economic restructuring of their neighbourhoods. the paper draws on an ethnographic case study in the neighbourhood of peckham, south london. it describes and analyses how overarching economic interests in neighbourhood development as well as culture, class, race, and other aspects of identity\\u2014simultaneously and interdependently\\u2014determine initiatives\\u2019 emergence and evolution. it draws attention to the fact that the distribution of costs and benefits associated with sustainability initiatives is not \\u2018neutral\\u2019. in doing so, it questions common, overly positive views of grassroots initiatives.\",\"modelling transitions: an appraisal of experiences and suggestions for research. formal modelling is potentially a useful method to help understand the many mechanisms underlying transitions and their complex interactions. this article reviews existing models of transitions. it examines the mechanisms they cover, and to what extent the models contribute to understanding core characteristics of transitions, notably multi-domain interactions, inertia to change resulting from path-dependency, and the processes that induce, and contribute to self-reinforcement of, change. it is further assessed how well the models capture real world mechanisms and how this is motivated. it is concluded that models addressing the full extent of transitions suffer from a weak micro-foundation and empirical validation, which is largely due to the scope of transitions and the fragmented theoretical basis of transition research. it is proposed that transitions be broken down into particular problems and components, and that where possible associated areas of interest be defined and addressed in corresponding models.\",\"a dramaturgy of critical moments in transition: understanding the dynamics of conflict in socio-political change. transitions are processes of major change and often come with conflict. there has been limited attention for the complex and multi-dimensional nature of conflict and its relation to transformative change. to capture this complexity, we use the case of ridesharing in indonesia and the dynamics of conflict that accompany the emergence of digital innovations in mobility services. we use the notion of \\u2018critical moments\\u2019 to be able to deepen the analysis on particular short timespans during which conflicts are particularly visible. for an in-depth understanding of these critical moments we look at the discursive enactment and mobilize dramaturgical analysis. we argue that: (1) multi-dimensional conflict analysis could be beneficial for transition studies; (2) critical moments are promising units of analysis in transition studies when analysing conflictual dynamics. (3) examining the dramaturgy of politics provides a useful framework and shed new light on where and how conflict in transition takes place and how it plays out.\",\"the institutionalisation of sustainable practices in cities: how initiatives shape local selection environments. the ways in which institutions are reconfigured to change mainstream selection pressures to favour sustainability is central to research on sustainability transitions but has only recently begun to receive more attention. of this existing work, empirical attention has mainly focused on the national level with less attention to local dynamics. attending to this gap, we mobilise theory on institutionalisation processes and insights from the politics of transitions literature and take an actor perspective to investigate the agency of local sustainability initiatives to navigate local governance processes and reconfigure selection environments at the urban scale. our work subsequently demonstrates the importance of diverse actor tactics, of networking for advocacy and of networking for the creation of informal, ad hoc governance arenas.\",\"interdependence between urban processes and energy transitions: the urban energy transitions (duet) framework. this paper presents a framework to study the interdependence between urban processes and energy transitions \\u2013 the dimensions of urban energy transitions (duet) framework. the framework emerges from current debates about the need to incorporate systematically the spatial and political dimensions of urban energy transitions. we seek to develop a systematic framework that brings together well-established principles of transitions theory with insights from recent debates about how transitions unfold in urban contexts. illustrated through a comparative meta-analysis of 29 case studies of urban energy transitions, the duet framework provides an approach that considers simultaneously three dimensions of energy transitions: socio-technical experimentation, urban political processes, and socio-spatial (re)configuration. the three dimensions interact closely with each other and together enforce \\u2018transitions of cities\\u2019. from duet framework, it argues that alignment between industry interests and territorial priorities is key to meaningful energy transitions.\",\"advancing urban transitions and transformations research. urban transitions and transformations research fosters a dialogue between sustainability transitions theory an inter- and transdisciplinary research on urban change. as a field, urban transitions and transformations research encompasses plural analytical and conceptual perspectives. in doing so, this field opens up sustainability transitions research to new communities of practice in urban environments, including mayors, transnational municipal networks, and international organizations.\",\"celebrating a decade of eist: what's next for transition studies?. this editorial introduces a special issue with 27 short viewpoints about future research on transition studies, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of this journal.\",\"diversity in transition: is transitions research diverse (enough)?. recently diversity in transitions research has achieved increasing attention. many diversity dimensions such as gender and geographical location, as well as their intersections, should be considered to achieve successful and just transitions. currently, transitions research is diverse in some aspects, but the broader framework for diverse transitions research is lacking. in this contribution, (i) we outline why diversity should be considered in the transitions research agenda, (ii) we demonstrate the extent of diversity in current transitions research, (iii) we provide examples of how diversity can be considered in transitions research, and (iv) we give recommendations to achieve a diversification of transitions research. from our perspective, social diversity deserves more attention in the next decade of transitions research, to enable just sustainable transitions - for everyone.\",\"environmental impact bonds as a transformative policy innovation: frames and frictions in the construction process of the nutrient-eib. impact bonds have emerged as a policy innovation with the potential to change public policies towards being more outcome-based and pre-emptive \\u2013 and more effective in answering sustainability challenges. this financial instrument has been used for social problems and only recently for environmental issues. one example is the nutrient-eib (environmental impact bond) which is in preparation to be implemented in southwest finland. we study involved stakeholders\\u2019 framings of the nutrient-eib's potential for solving problems of eutrophication of the baltic sea and the lock-in situation of recycled fertiliser development. based on stakeholder interviews, we identify three interpretative frames: applying the impact investing logic, challenging agri-environmental policy, and extending experimental policy-making. we recognise frictions between the frames regarding the required knowledge base and scale. we discuss how visions of transformative outcomes may challenge each other and what kinds of barriers transformative policy innovations may face.\",\"conceptualising the built environment to inform sustainable urban transitions. despite the prominence of cities within sustainability transitions, the scholarship has been criticised for its lack of engagement with spatiality. this article engages with physical change in urban environments through a critical scholarly review of interdisciplinary scholarship. this paper deconstructs conceptualisations of the built environment and identifies the similarities, contestations and unaddressed components in conceptualising the built environment across urban morphology, spatial-political economy, urban planning, and urban design. following this, the paper reconstructs the built environment, reflecting on sustainability transitions scholarship. the analysis highlights this physicality as a necessary component for consideration when preparing any form of systemic urban change, especially when attempting to understand multi-sectoral transitions. overall, the review reveals the need for a future research agenda that explicitly explores the role of the built environment and its creators in influencing multi-sectoral sustainability transitions.\",\"deep transitions: theorizing the long-term patterns of socio-technical change. the contemporary world is confronted by a double challenge: environmental degradation and social inequality. this challenge is linked to the dynamics of the first deep transition (schot, 2016): the creation and expansion of a wide range of socio-technical systems in a similar direction over the past 200\\u2013250 years. extending the theoretical framework of schot and kanger (2018), this paper proposes that the first deep transition has been built up through successive great surges of development (perez, 2002), leading to the emergence of a macro-level selection environment called industrial modernity. this has resulted in the formation of a portfolio of directionality, characterized by dominant and durable directions and occasional discontinuous shifts in addition to a continuous variety of alternatives sustained in niches or single systems. this historically-informed view on the co-evolution of single socio-technical systems, complexes of systems and industrial modernity has distinctive implications for policy-making targeted at resolving the current challenges.\",\"addressing social representations in socio-technical transitions with the case of shale gas. while sociologists of science and technology have long understood technological diffusion and adoption as processes of social embedding, the psycho-social processes involved have received relatively little attention in the socio-technical transitions literature. here we consider the value of moscovici's social representations theory in terms of its potential contribution to a theory of socio-technical change, the multi-level perspective (mlp). using fracking-derived shale gas as a technology case study and newspaper representations of the technology in poland, germany and the uk as data, we address and illustrate connections between the processes of anchoring and objectification that are central to social representations theory and the socio-technical dynamics observed. in so doing, we set out an approach for further work on agency in the mlp and socio-technical change processes generally, informed by a social psychological approach that aligns with structuralist concepts.\",\"connecting the multi-level-perspective and social practice approach for sustainable transitions. the increasing sense of urgency to transition to sustainable modes of consumption and production requires an understanding of social problem framings and processes of change. we examine how two conceptual frameworks, the multi-level perspective (mlp), a socio-technical transition theory, and social practice approaches (spa), contribute to understanding opportunities for social change. we share the results of a systematic literature review that seeks a better understanding of how these two approaches are co-employed. we first present quantifiable results from an analysis of 118 publications; we then focus on a qualitative analysis to investigate conceptual complementarities while recognizing their ontological differences. we find further entry points where the two approaches can be fruitfully combined, such as the study of vulnerable proto-practices, research on informal regimes, and the development of landscape- and supra-practice-level meanings. we conclude with recommendations on how to further operationalize the co-employment of mlp and spa in sustainability transition studies.\",\"social enterprises towards a sustainable business system: a model of institutional dynamics. despite the growing interest of sustainability transition studies on the role of business actors in shaping transitions, the institutionalized logic of the capitalist enterprise underlying such agency has been overlooked. however, such logic might be understood as a dominant regime that leads to unsustainable systems. we intend to contribute to transitions research by focusing on the agency of social enterprises as non-dominant actors searching for challenging and transforming the institutionalized logics in the business system. therefore, we disentangle the institutional mechanisms driven by social enterprises by proposing a theoretical model built upon a literature review of sustainability transitions from institutional perspectives, offering a set of explanatory propositions to allow empirical examination. those mechanisms and propositions operate at three levels: inside the individual, inside the niche, and at the interplay between the niche and the business regime. finally, we include a real-world example of a social enterprise to illustrate the model.\",\"the double hermeneutic of sustainability transitions. how should sustainability transitions deal with the fact that 'transition' has become a buzzword in political discourse and a label for social ecology movements? building on giddens' conception of a double hermeneutic, the paper explores the current appropriations and interpretations of the transition category by political and social actors, and outlines the challenges and opportunities of this double hermenetic in terms of symbolic politics and transformative research.\",\"a brake or an accelerator? the role of law in sustainability transitions. the role of law is arguably of key importance in rapid sustainability transition. however, neither past nor current transition research explicitly engages with law in relation to transition, and when it engages with law at all, it adopts an instrumental view of it rather than a complex-systemic one. similarly, there is a lack of broad-ranging legal scholarship on the role of law in transition. we argue that there is a need to bridge the gap between legal and transition research to support the achievement of sustainability goals, and propose a conceptual framework to initiate such a dialogue. the various accelerating, braking and steering roles that the law plays in transition forms the core of our framework in tandem with an argument to the effect that law is a complex system containing legal forces that both support and hinder sustainability transition.\",\"destabilizing the food regime \\u201cfrom within\\u201d: tools and strategies used by urban food policy actors. in the context of food transition studies scant attention has been given to the role of state authorities (be they local or national) in destabilizing the dominant food regime. specifically, little is known about how state-based regime actors use the power at their disposal to bring about change \\u201cfrom within\\u201d. using a political economy approach and data from qualitative research with local government actors in 10 european cities, this paper explores the different power instruments utilized by (local) government authorities to undermine the material, organizational and discursive base of the (conventional) agri-food regime. what emerges from our research is that local authorities have used a mix of discursive, material and organizational tools to alter the dominant narrative around food and have reoriented material resources towards activities that support a new approach to food. obstacles in this transition pathway lie in ensuring internal coordination within cities and vertical alliances with higher administrative levels.\",\"alteration spaces: charting the sustainability potential of large organizations. large organizations play a key role in sustainability transitions through their systems of production and consumption and their influence on wider society. recognizing the uniqueness and complexity of structure-agency relations in organizations, this paper uses the example of food provisioning to compare the sustainability potential of eight national and multinational organizations located in ireland. by introducing the novel concept of \\u2018alteration spaces\\u2019 to describe specific intra-organizational structure-agency constellations and their dynamics over time, we question existing interventionist views of organizational change. we argue these tend to overstate extra-organizational impulses for change while paying insufficient attention to organizational culture and committed individuals as potential sustainability advocates within organizations. this, in turn, facilitates a reconceptualization of individual agency as embedded within an organizational context, thereby challenging dominant understandings that disregard the potential of established organizations to initiate intra-organizational changes that shape and reflect sustainability transitions.\",\"community-based initiatives and the politicization gap in socio-ecological transitions: lessons from portugal. community-based initiatives (cbis) are an embodiment and potential catalyst of societal change towards sustainability. in portugal, they remain a largely untapped resource. this paper examines different nuances of cbis\\u2019 societal change agency by proposing an innovative inquiry framework focused on substance, processes and outcomes via an actor, politics and governance-centered approach. through an inward- versus outward-looking dialectical reflection on cbis\\u2019 politicization dynamics, we analyze portugal's cbi landscape drawing upon previous research, databases and semi-structured interviews. we conclude that a politicization gap and the absence of both socio-political visibility and of favorable institutional and policy frameworks are crucial contextual premises hindering cbis\\u2019 change agency. notwithstanding, cbi's transformative potential is undeniable. we find them perfectly positioned to mediate co-shaping processes between social innovators and incumbent institutions, contesting the latter's unsustainable development logic. if cbis and governments acknowledge the complementarity of their scope of societal change agency, cbis\\u2019 transformational time may have arrived.\",\"exploring the governance and politics of transformations towards sustainability. the notion of \\u2018transformations towards sustainability\\u2019 takes an increasingly central position in global sustainability research and policy discourse in recent years. governance and politics are central to understanding and analysing transformations towards sustainability. however, despite receiving growing attention in recent years, the governance and politics aspects of transformations remain arguably under-developed in the global sustainability literature. a variety of conceptual approaches have been developed to understand and analyse societal transition or transformation processes, including: socio-technical transitions, social-ecological systems, sustainability pathways, and transformative adaptation. this paper critically surveys these four approaches, and reflects on them through the lens of the earth system governance framework (biermann et al., 2009). this contributes to appreciating existing insights on transformations, and to identifying key research challenges and opportunities. overall, the paper brings together diverse perspectives, that have so far remained largely fragmented, in order to strengthen the foundation for future research on transformations towards sustainability.\",\"the potential of sustainability-oriented digital platform multinationals: a comment on the transitions research agenda. this article points at insights from the subfields of international business and strategic management that are relevant for sustainability transitions research. specifically, building on the emergent \\u2018mainstream\\u2019 literature on \\u2018generic\\u2019 digital platforms, we explain how a range of digital platform multinationals has emerged which address sustainability challenges, and highlight their potential for accelerating multi-sector transitions across geographies. the article does not cover contested platforms such as airbnb and uber, but focuses on sustainability-oriented digital platform multinationals (so-dpms), which directly tackle social and/or environmental issues by enabling new linkages between individuals and/or organizations. these so-dpms deserve more research attention because of their ability to affect sustainability transitions in their own (home) and foreign (host) countries, and realize interconnections and replication across borders. besides explicating their relevance for sustainability transitions research, we propose promising areas for investigation, considering so-dpms, actors in their networks, and society more broadly.\",\"strategic niche management in transition pathways: telework advocacy as groundwork for an incremental transformation. this article presents telework advocacy in the united states as a case of strategic niche management that contributed to an incremental transformation of office work location practice in the united states. in its first decades, telework advocacy showed elements of strategic niche management including vision and expectations, learning processes, and social networks. supported by environmental and economic landscape pressures, trip reduction and travel demand management policies opened up protected spaces at the local, state, or federal levels for the practice of telework, with public agencies as experimenters. niche and incumbent actors shared a strategy of promoting telework in structured circumstances and spoke to organizational and employee benefit alongside societal benefits. yet as landscape pressures lessened, incumbent actors took greater ownership of the innovations of telework, and shifted their vision to one that considers telecommuting as a function of human resources rather than a societal imperative.\",\"biting the bullet: addressing the democratic legitimacy of transition management. from early on, reflexive governance approaches have been problematised for lacking explicit consideration of formal governance and decision-making structures. developed over two decades ago, transition management is not an exception; it has been specifically critiqued for being democratically illegitimate and depoliticising issues. contributing to these debates, this article develops a legitimacy framework for understanding how transition management practices can be legitimised within liberal democratic structures, while safeguarding their transformative potential, or, \\u2018radical core\\u2019, while navigating innovation capture. this framework guides a comparative analysis of six european cities, who employ transition management practices for developing decarbonisation roadmaps towards 2050. we discuss the emphasis on liberal democratic norms, the fuzziness of practices of participation and the closing down of policy options. we recommend the legitimacy framework to be used as a heuristic for reflexive governance, tool for explicating the conditionality of \\u2018radicality\\u2019 in transition management, and guide for designing accountability governance structures.\",\"workers as actors at the micro-level of sustainability transitions: a systematic literature review. work and workers have been neglected topics in sustainability transitions research. our systematic literature review of 28 academic papers on the subject reveals five ways in which workers are affected or otherwise linked to transitions, indicating the relevance of further empirical studies on the role played by different groups of workers. first, environmental policies and other macro-level changes have indirect consequences for workers. second, new sustainable work practices emerge or face insurmountable obstacles depending on meso\\u2011 and micro-level change dynamics. third, workers may adopt mediating positions and act as intermediaries in transitions. fourth, novel educational programmes evolve to equip workers with new skills, and fifth, transitions may lead to the creation of new jobs in the labour market. co-evolutionary change dynamics of sustainability transitions affect workers in both formal and informal forms of employment, and these questions in accelerating transitions require further attention.\",\"engaging with multi-system interactions in sustainability transitions: a comment on the transitions research agenda. as sustainability challenges and the transformative changes they necessitate stretch well beyond the boundaries of individual socio-technical systems, there is a pressing need to generate more sustained interest in the dynamics occurring across rather than within systems. in response, this viewpoint takes stock of existing work on multi-system dynamics and sketches the contours of a multi-system perspective, which conceptualizes the interactions among systems as diverse, layered, and evolving. a multi-system perspective draws attention to: the present functional and structural couplings that link systems of interest; emerging sites of interaction that could bring systems further into contact; along with the patterns marking system interactions and their implications for sustainability transitions. attending more carefully to multi-system dynamics complements several promising directions of inquiry identified by the agenda for sustainability transitions research, including recent efforts to broaden the scope of analysis, capture the pervasiveness of change, and consider opportunities for acceleration.\",\"neglected developments undermining sustainability transitions. sustainability transitions are key to addressing grand challenges confronting humanity, yet there are many developments that undermine this endeavor. for example, new products and industries emerge that exacerbate existing challenges, instead of mitigating them. context systems such as policy making, finance, education or independent journalism, which provide critical resources for transitions, transform in ways that hamper their ability to support sustainability transitions. we argue that transitions research needs explicitly to confront unfavorable developments in order to create a broader repertoire of strategies, including precautionary policies, to better orchestrate sustainability transitions.\",\"the local community as a \\\"low-carbon lab\\\": promises and perils. strategic niche management (snm) conceives of local experiments within protected spaces as important initiators of learning and empowerment of new sustainable technologies. we complement political perspectives on local experiments with evidence on the personal experiences of local and national-level decision makers involved in a finnish programme called carbon-neutral municipalities, which engaged five small municipalities as \\\"low carbon labs\\\". the snm literature can benefit from an understanding of how ordinary people experience experiments and interpret their results. we suggest that low-carbon experiments can offer promise to ordinary citizens and politicians by supporting the deployment of new technologies, contributing to local learning, offering outside input, and offering \\\"proof of principle\\\" that greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced. however, ordinary people judge experimentation on different criteria than scientists. in order to serve as \\\"proof of principle\\\" and encourage people to persist in climate action, local low-carbon experiments cannot afford to fail.\",\"ten challenges for computer models in transitions research: commentary on holtz et al.. the emergence of a dedicated modelling community within the transitions field is to be welcomed, and the authors of a recent paper in eist (holtz et al., 2015) make many valuable points. we build on their position paper in two ways. first, we reflect on some of the ways in which modelling in other areas of \\u2018sustainability science\\u2019 has sometimes fallen short of the strengths articulated. second, we extend some of holtz et al.\\u2019s discussion of the epistemological and ontological challenges for modelling transitions. we suggest ten challenges in response to the more optimistic claims made by holtz et al., and we provide some additional suggestions for ways forward. in particular, we suggest that seeking closer integration of qualitative, socio-technical analysis with models may not always be the best strategy. rather, pluralist \\u2018bridging strategies\\u2019 and dialogue between analytic approaches may be more productive.\",\"how transition management can inform development aid. it is argued that transition management can be a useful analytical approach for clarifying how development aid can stimulate economic development. to illustrate this, potential applications are suggested. three similarities between transition management and development aid are identified. in addition, the reverse potential influence, from development aid thinking to transition management, is briefly discussed.\",\"capitalism in sustainability transitions research: time for a critical turn?. sustainability transition research (str) has failed to engage in any significant analyses or critiques of capitalism. this article argues that capitalism is not a \\u2018landscape\\u2019 factor, but rather permeates the workings of socio-technical systems in ways that must be recognised both for elaborating rigorous accounts of transition trajectories and for enhancing the capacity of str to support future societal sustainability transitions. this argument is developed specifically in relation to the three challenges of str: the analysis of the actual sustainability of sustainability transitions, the application of transition theory to cases in the global south, and the move towards a forward-looking str. the article identifies three main implications of this argument with respect to interdisciplinarity, the validity of current theoretical frameworks, and the practice of str. ultimately, the article invites str scholars to be more openly reflexive not only about possible theoretical biases, but also regarding their own roles in society.\",\"harnessing theories of the policy process for analysing the politics of sustainability transitions: a critical survey. this paper provides a survey of policy process theories and their usefulness in transitions research. some research has already used such theories, but often in an ad hoc and relatively cursory way and with little attention to potential alternatives. however, it has been argued that transition scholars need to pay more attention to the politics of policy processes. we argue that a critical stocktaking of policy process theories is a prerequisite for future transition studies that more systematically respond to these challenges. therefore, we review five prominent policy process theories and their applicability in transition studies. we point to two weaknesses of empirical applications of these approaches that are of particular relevance for transitions research: their focus on single instruments or policy packages, and their neglect of policy outcomes. we conclude by suggesting avenues for research on the linkages between policy processes, policy mixes, and socio-technical change.\",\"resilience and sustainability in the face of disasters. very few of the large number of major disasters in recent years have threatened the survival of the host region. improvements in conditions underlying sustainability have helped in this regard, as has inherent and adaptive resilience associated with disaster recovery. sharp breaks from the past do not appear to be the norm, but opportunities for major transitions do increase in the aftermath of disasters. this paper examines some major types of resilience that have been effective and encourages their incorporation into long-term recovery and mitigation strategies.\",\"locked in unsustainability: understanding lock-ins and their interactions using the case of food packaging. lock-in mechanisms are major hurdles to sustainability transitions. scholars identified various types of lock-ins; however, their dynamics and interactions remain underexplored. using the case of food packaging, this study enhances the conceptual understanding and empirical analysis of lock-ins and their interactions from a socio-technical perspective. we analyze the material, institutional, behavioral, and discursive configuration and the shallow and deep lock-ins reinforcing the persistent dominance of single-use over reusable food packaging in germany. additionally, we explore the lock-in interactions both within and between the socio-technical elements. hence, we introduce archetypical interlock-ins and lock-in clusters pointing to core trends of resistance towards reusable packaging alternatives. this study advances the lock-in concept for future socio-technical analyses while guiding the illumination of the complex dynamics of stability, the assessment of current sustainability transition interventions, and the search for potential unlocking strategies to enable change.\",\"co-producing urban sustainability transitions knowledge with community, policy and science. this viewpoint presents insights on designing, engaging with and researching multi-stakeholder engagement spaces based on the experience of the arts project (2014\\u20132016), active in five european cities also relevant for a broader european scale. we argue that those spaces represent an important new instrument of participatory governance that can elucidate the way different actors like community initiatives relate to and employ planning and policy contexts for working towards sustainable urban futures. the multi-stakeholder engagement spaces are analyzed regarding three functions they fulfill: co-creating new knowledge for action, making sense of contemporary transitions, and, exploring how sustainable solutions impact transitions. the lessons learned focus on the roles of different actors within those spaces as well as the link between the multi-stakeholder engagement spaces and a broader local context. we name three caveats including deeply entrenched mistrust between local transition initiatives and local government representatives, existing power imbalances and inclusivity.\",\"sustainable prosperity and societal transitions: long-term modeling for anticipatory management. the coupled nature of human and earth system dynamics has become increasingly apparent as humanity's environmental footprint has increased. yet, the methods and processes used to understand and guide those dynamics remain deficient in their treatment of that coupling. lack of bi-directional coupling of human system dynamics with the dynamics of the larger environment within which humanity operates stymies the ability of researchers and policymakers to anticipate and limit the unintended consequences of technological change and help guide associated societal transitions. this paper lays out elements of a research agenda to ameliorate those deficiencies.\",\"lewin's field theory as a lens for understanding incumbent actors\\u2019 agency in sustainability transitions. understanding incumbent actors\\u2019 behavior is one of the current key targets in sustainability transitions research. scholars studying incumbents\\u2019 agency have demanded the inclusion of broader social-science theories that bridge different levels (i.e., individual, group) and enable the inclusion of a multitude of actors\\u2019 drivers and motives into one coherent framework. the present article suggests that kurt lewin's field theory, an influential theory of social and organizational change, may be suited for this purpose. from the perspective of field theory, actors are exposed to various partially conflicting \\u2018field forces\\u2019 (e.g., related to needs, expectations, or roles). the relative strength of these forces determines actors\\u2019 decisions and behavior. the paper introduces key concepts of lewin's field theory and reinterprets incumbents\\u2019 responses to sustainability transitions from a field-theoretical perspective. it elaborates on potential theoretical and methodical benefits of lewin's field theory for studying incumbents\\u2019 agency and closes with a discussion of practical implications.\",\"the mirage of integration: taking a street-level perspective on the nexus approach. the nexus approach for sustainable management of natural resources combines environmental management and governance across sectors and scales. this approach, along with other integrative practices, has however seen limited uptake in practice despite its great promise. drawing on the \\u2018street-level bureaucracy concept\\u2019, this article examines the role of policymakers in a nexus project, using interviews with international civil servants on a natural resource use team. barriers and opportunities for the adoption of integrative thinking are identified, and factors influencing the nexus process are found to range from individual, organizational, contextual, and political factors to external actors. the most prominent factor is found to be individual factors, mainly due to discretion during implementation and individual values and norms. solutions to improve adoption will vary depending on the operational environment and the article highlights the importance of perspective knowledge and a sound theoretical understanding of complex systems involved.\",\"seedbeds, harbours, and battlegrounds: on the origins of favourable environments for urban experimentation with sustainability. urban experimentation (ue) is seen as crucial for enacting transformations towards sustainability. research in this domain has flourished, but still lacks theoretical coherence. we review this emerging literature, combining methods for problematisation and critical interpretive synthesis, to address two questions: how does the extant literature conceive of the contexts in which experimentation emerge, and what dynamics are thought to be implicated in reconfiguring these contexts into favourable environments for ue? traditionally, transition studies assume that cities may act as protective spaces for experimentation, but recent studies suggest other salient dynamics. we identify three lenses - seedbeds, harbours, and battlegrounds \\u2013 which articulate the assumptions and dynamics associated with different understandings of the urban context. we argue for plural accounts of how ue thrives in particular places and offer a way \\u2018to follow\\u2019 the co-evolution between a multiplicity of experiments and their environment, through interactions between protection, connectivity, and conflict.\",\"exploring the economic crisis from a transition management perspective. this article explores the current economic crisis from a transition management perspective. we argue that it is a symptom of underlying persistent unsustainability in socio-economic systems which may result in profound systemic changes, i.e. transitions. dominant regime responses to the economic crisis so far seem to focus primarily on restoring the old equilibrium. adopting a transition management perspective, we argue that we can see the economic crisis as an accelerator in a process of fundamental systemic change and need to identify options to increase the chance that it will lead to sustainability. we note that general patterns and mechanisms can be identified in distinct transition domains (currencies, resources and governance) that enable and help scale-up sustainability alternatives. transition management research and practice should focus on identifying and providing the necessary generic-'glocal governance'-conditions under which the unsustainable regimes are discouraged and emerging sustainability transitions accelerated.\",\"historical industrial transitions influence local sustainability planning, capability, and performance. we evaluate the influence of long-term industrial transitions on local sustainability action. we construct two aspects of historical industrial transitions\\u2014direction and magnitude\\u2014along with three aspects of local government sustainability action: planning, capabilities, and performance. using a national survey of local sustainability practice and nearly five decades of historical manufacturing employment data in the u.s., we find local communities with more substantial swings in manufacturing jobs to be less likely to engage in sustainability planning, cultivate sustainability-related capabilities, and make progress towards meeting sustainability-related objectives, underscoring the potential challenges associated with top-down programs and the importance of decentralized solutions.\",\"designing fluid futures: hybrid transitions to sustainable architectures. transitions towards sustainable architecture range from best practice exemplars based upon low carbon technical performance to aestheticized, iconic visions of sustainability framed by specific environmental philosophies. the resulting heterogeneity of design strategies serve as illuminating examples of the paradoxes that face efforts to design, develop and inhabit sustainable built form. in response, this paper argues for an alternative, more fluid interpretive frame, which acknowledges and even celebrates design diversity and acknowledges multiple transition points towards sustainability through the contingent, often messy practices through which architectural artefacts are assembled across sites and societies.\",\"between hope, hype, and hell: electric mobility and the interplay of fear and desire in sustainability transitions. conceptualizations and articulations of \\u2018the future\\u2019 play a persistent and important role in discussions about technology adoption and the broader domain of sustainability transitions. the sociology of expectations, part of the transitions and science and technology studies literature, specifically focusses on the performative role that desirable expectations play in the development and marketing of a technology. in this paper we argue that these insights can be coupled with the performative role of undesirable futures, as outlined by critical security studies. based on a qualitative diffractive reading of these twin literatures we argue that the performativity around desired and undesired futures follows distinct yet complementary logics. our reading highlights that a focus on expectations alone does not fully explain the initiation and success of a sustainable innovation, nor that a focus on undesired futures fully explains the acceptance of security claims. the paper exemplifies these insights with a reflection on electric vehicle development.\",\"see no evil, hear no evil: the democratic potential of transition management. various scholars have critically reflected upon transition management, some explicitly called for thinking beyond existing paradigms of institutional and deliberative democracy. taking up this challenge, this paper seeks to explore inherent democratic tensions of managing (socio-technical) transitions. to this end, it presents a 'post-foundational' understanding of democratic politics, contrasting it to traditional notions of democracy that dominate transition approaches. to explore the relationship between transition management and post-foundational democracy, the paper first empirically explores how the democratic politics of an urban regeneration process play out in a dutch delta city (rotterdam's city ports). this case illustrates that contrary to traditional conceptions of democracy, a more 'extra-institutional' transition management process can create space for a different type of democratic governance. we argue that post-foundational democracy reframes our understanding of the politics of governing (socio-technical) transitions.\",\"the role of regime-level processes in closing the gap between sustainable city visions and action. there is an implementation gap between cities\\u2019 long-term sustainable visions and the short-term actions realised to achieve them. to accelerate sustainable urban transitions a greater understanding of the regime-level processes that enable or constrain translation between long-term visions and short-term action is required. transition research to date has neglected regime processes, especially cultural-cognitive habits and heuristics, and the role of power and agency. to address this a novel analytical framework is proposed, with transition theory as the basis, additionally drawing on institutional and quasi-evolutionary theory. this framework is tested using copenhagen as a case study, generating important insights; in particular that normative institutional processes are an effective means for regime actors to coordinate power, affect resource allocation, and impact selection pressures and adaptive capacity. the findings suggests that unless the institutional and quasi-evolutionary processes that drive action are re-configured in line with sustainable city visions then progress will be limited.\",\"the role of local government greening policies in the transition towards nature-based cities. as urban areas increase in size, density and population, green spaces become increasingly important for sustainability and liveability. yet urbanisation processes, compounded in many cases by climate change impacts, are placing increasing pressure on retention of urban vegetation. this paper aims to analyse the role of local government policies in provision of urban green spaces. the research focuses on policies of three neighbouring local governments in melbourne australia, representing inner, middle and outer urban contexts. the paper applies transition management's four spheres, strategic, tactical, operational and reflexive, to structure the analysis. the research identified key policy success factors and related these to the four spheres of analysis. the research found that a key limitation to a consistent or unified approach to green space provision is the \\u2018splintered\\u2019 or competing narratives that are applied to the functions, benefits and characteristics of urban green spaces. this fragmentation slows transition to nature-based cities.\",\"the role of place in shaping urban transformative capacity. the case of val\\u00e8ncia (spain). this paper inquiries into the role of place in shaping urban transformative capacity to advance urban sustainability transitions. the urban transformative capacity notion developed by wolfram (2016) provides us with a holistic framework to reconceptualize and address the specific contextual conditions that become relevant in a city to advance path-deviant changes towards sustainability. by comparing the energy and agri-food socio-technical systems in the city of val\\u00e8ncia (spain), insights have been gained into key contextual factors shaping urban transformative capacity; specifically, the previous local historical trajectories regarding each socio-technical system, the role of local social movements and local government as articulator of the different components of the framework. additionally, the way different accounts of sustainability coexist and the interaction between different socio-technical systems at urban level appear as critical issues.\",\"how actors can influence the legitimation of new consumer product categories: a theoretical framework. the establishment of a new product category can have an important impact on the pace and direction of sustainability transitions. however, the current sustainable transition literature neglects the process through which such a product category becomes legitimate and the role that different actors can play in this process of legitimation. this paper investigates the theoretical concept of legitimacy in relation to the introduction of a new product category during sustainability transitions. a theoretical framework for the legitimation of new product categories is presented, the product legitimation framework (plf). five factors that influence legitimacy are introduced: comprehension, output, compatibility, signalling, and procedural justice. different actors, like producers and governments, are believed to influence these legitimising factors by using the following tools: frames, activities, products, and enactment of law. special attention is given to the role of the product itself in the legitimation process.\",\"identity in sustainability transitions: the crucial role of landscape in the green heart. this article proposes that identity formation and reformation are important dynamics that influence and are influenced by the course of a sustainability transition. we study identity (re-)formation in the transition of the dairy sector in a rural area in the netherlands: the green heart. soil subsidence, high emissions, and economic pressures require substantial changes in practices in the dairy sector and most importantly, the landscape that it is intertwined with. we use narrative analysis to study identity (re-)formation in two new stakeholder collectives that aim to address sustainability in the area. we identify discrepancies between the narratives in these collectives and the transition challenge. these discrepancies can be explained by the role that the landscape of the green heart plays in the identity (re-)formation within these collectives. the attachment to the current landscape forms a lock-in for the sustainability transition in this area.\",\"exploring window of opportunity dynamics in infrastructure transformation. this paper examines how infrastructure investments could create conditions favoring the commercialization of sustainable niche technologies. while the transition literature has traditionally treated existing infrastructure as a barrier, recent research has emphasized that infrastructure transformation can function as a facilitator, helping sustainable niche technologies break through. however, few have investigated the dynamics of such processes. this paper conceptualizes how window of opportunity dynamics can arise during infrastructure transformation. the paper is based on a case study of the planning of the i-710 project in southern california, the first infrastructure project in which zero-emission truck technology was to be deployed on a large scale. this paper illustrates how infrastructure transformation can play a contradictory role, acting as a barrier or facilitator depending on the niche empowerment processes. furthermore, this paper addresses the selection mechanisms of infrastructure projects and the interplay between infrastructure design and the business models underlying niche innovations.\",\"making sustainability transitions research policy-relevant: challenges at the science-policy interface. in this policy brief, we provide an overview of a recently published report by the european environment agency: \\u2018sustainability transitions: policy and practice\\u2019, which we co-authored. we discuss the report's context and rationale, namely as part of a knowledge brokering process initiated at the eea since 2015 and intended to explore the practical implications of transitions research for policy. we outline the report's 10 key messages, which concern core processes, stages and change mechanisms, key cross-cutting themes, and governance-related challenges for steering transition processes. we also reflect on the report's findings and the broader knowledge development process, identifying a number of topics the transitions community could further investigate, and highlighting challenges and opportunities for science-policy interactions.\",\"creating copenhagen's metro - on the role of protected spaces in arenas of development. the conception of copenhagen's metro is analysed as part of a strategy to rescue copenhagen from a stalemate in transportation and city space planning and to transform it into a pole in europe and the locomotive of denmark's development. through an arenas of development (aod) analysis, we argue that copenhagen's economic difficulties were due to three arenas: denmark's national transportation strategy; the regional fiscal balance; and copenhagen's transportation and planning. to remedy this stalemate, the danish national government and copenhagen's administration were instrumental in staging a new arena, the metropolitan area problem, which made possible the creation of protected spaces for policy changes, transportation solutions, and a redefinition of copenhagen's metropolitan area.\",\"a participatory systems mapping approach for sustainability transitions: insights from an experience in the tourism sector in portugal. the use of participatory modelling approaches in sustainability transition studies has been limited despite its potential contributions to transitions research. in this article, a methodological framework was designed based on a participatory systems mapping (psm) approach to structure and frame sustainability problems in transition management processes. the framework comprises three phases: 1) transition framing and actor selection, 2) psm transition workshop, and 3) synthesis and evaluation. in a case study of the portuguese tourism sector, participants created a shared systems view of tourism sustainability issues, based on the development of causal loop diagrams. transition concepts, such as landscape-regime and niche-regime interactions, are specified in the diagrams. the psm approach also provided a collaborative platform for co-creation of shared sustainability visions, thus fostering formalisation of a broad roadmap for desired transition pathways.\",\"a reflexive perspective for sustainability assumptions in transition studies. the sustainability transitions literature addresses globally pressing sustainability challenges. however, the scholars in the field trend towards using the term \\u201csustainability\\u201d in a manner that is not reflexive, often just assuming that the studied cases contribute to more sustainable modes of production and consumption. in this paper, we suggest an alternative: a reflexive sustainability perspective that takes into account case selection issue, sources of unsustainability, double-edged sword dilemma, and boundary problem. using this perspective as our starting point, we conduct a case survey, analyzing the extent to which such a perspective is considered in a number of selected case-based transition studies. we find that the deeper reasons for unsustainability and alternative sustainability solutions are often overlooked, sustainability trade-offs are mostly not considered, and the potential sustainability effects beyond the case boundaries are typically not reflected on. based on these considerations, we provide scholars with some implications and suggestions on how to reflect on their own sustainability assumptions and contribute to more reflexive scholarship in the future.\",\"planning roles in infrastructure system transitions: a review of research bridging socio-technical transitions and planning. human settlements, particularly cities and their surrounding regions, are sites of infrastructural intensity and agglomeration, presenting challenges and opportunities for sustainable development. both strategic spatial planning and sustainable transitions examine the interrelationships of urban, regional and infrastructural sustainability. interdisciplinary interactions between planning and transitions in these contexts require further examination. this integrative literature review examines 30 journal articles with the aim of identifying the roles planning plays in sustainable infrastructure system transitions. research examining local and regional infrastructure and urban transitions highlights the relational and contingent roles planning plays in place-based contexts. the review distils and discusses seven roles played by planning in sustainable transitions. examining these roles provides insight into equipping planning, as a spatial and integrated policy process, for engaging with socio-technical transitions in complex policy processes.\",\"robert ayres, ecological economics and industrial ecology. this editorial motivates the special issue containing articles in honour of professor robert u. ayres. a concise history of robert ayres' research is presented, which identifies relevant publications and ideas. in addition, the eight contributions to this special issue are briefly summarized. they provide connections to relevant insights in related fields, namely ecological economics and industrial ecology, which allows enriching the research on environmental innovation and societal transitions. most contributions end with clear suggestions for transitions policy.\",\"the influence of public funding on community-based sustainability projects in scotland. community-based initiatives (cbis) towards sustainability are increasing. their activities and impacts have attracted academic interest but little attention has been given to how cbis engage with policy and institutional spaces. one way in which cbis engage with these spaces is through receiving public funding. this paper looks at the challenges and opportunities that public funding presents for community groups. data for this paper were gathered though interviews with cbis and public funding bodies. the findings show that cbis experience challenges negotiating technical and procedural, goals and ways of working, affecting their identity and aspirations. in conclusion, we argue that although public funding is crucial for cbis, it is accompanied by a range of managerial and technical procedures that enrol cbis in state accountability mechanisms. this may have the effect of favouring a certain type of cbis or excluding those that cannot or will not accept public funding.\",\"capturing the micro-level of intermediation in transitions: comparing ethnographic and interview methods. to date, a major portion of sustainability transition research has relied on retrospective methods to generate encompassing macro-level views of transitions. however, such methods may have considerable impacts on the insights generated in the study of intermediation, action and agency by actors on the micro-level of transitions. in this article, we compare retrospective interviews and real-time ethnography to understand how they portray micro-level transition processes and intermediation. the empirical context of our study is energy retrofitting, which we use to illustrate three structural and three process aspects that distinguish the findings from retrospective interviewing and real-time ethnography. ethnographic methods can provide significant new detail on the uncertainty and complexity of micro-level transition processes while interviews facilitate cross-case comparison and understanding of commonalities in micro-level transition intermediation processes better.\",\"three perspectives on regime destabilisation governance: a metatheoretical analysis of german pesticide policy. the deliberate destabilisation of socio-technical regimes receives increasing attention in sustainability transition governance. existing conceptualisations differ substantially in underlying assumptions and analytical scope. yet, a systematic identification of differences between analytical frameworks is missing. to fill this gap, we explore the explanatory power of a deliberative, a regulatory and a transition pathways perspective on regime destabilisation governance. each represented by a key analytical framework, these perspectives are comparatively applied to german pesticide policy in the context of european multilevel governance. we find that each documents different aspects of governance efforts to destabilise the incumbent pesticide regime. through a content analysis of policy documents, we reveal how policy, especially on the european level, is increasingly, but incompletely oriented away from the incumbent pesticide regime, expressed in discursive shifts, changes in policy instruments and evolving political goal setting, respectively. thus, we identify avenues for developing more robust frameworks of regime destabilisation governance.\",\"moral entrepreneurship: thinking and acting at the landscape level to foster sustainability transitions. this research contributes to an important yet overlooked theme in sustainability transitions scholarship: the role of normative deliberation in large-scale systemic change. we adopt the term \\u201cmoral entrepreneur\\u201d to describe the deliberate efforts to change institutionalized moral norms, and thus foster sustainability transitions. we adopt an interdisciplinary approach and, by drawing on the institutional lens, synthesize the multi-level perspective from sustainability transitions studies with the scholarship on discursive action from organization and management studies to explore the mechanisms by which moral entrepreneurs contribute to transformative change. based on an analysis of the creation of the american national parks in the early 20th century and specifically john muir's role therein, we argue that moral entrepreneurs trigger landscape level changes by gradually disassociating rules and practices from their moral foundations through engaging in a macro-systemic discourse.\",\"breaking out of sustainability impasses: how to apply frame analysis, reframing and transition theory to global health challenges. we combine frame analysis and transition theory into a thinking tool in sustainability science and analyse three serious and persistent problems in global health subject to sustainability impasses: hiv/aids, malaria, and indoor air pollution. frame analysis identifies how problems are encased by scientific understandings and captured by transition barriers: policy cooptation, technoinstitutional lock-in, and knowledge trap. transition theory locates the transition barriers on a temporal scale and a conceptual level: landscape, regime, and niches. frame analysis reveals how problems are embedded in particular narratives while reframing stimulates alternative understandings and problem solutions. boundary work facilitates knowledge integration across units and transition management promotes actor oriented problem resolution. the thinking tool unites critical with problem solving research and ties reframing to analytical and temporal understandings of social change. the aim is dual: to advance methodology while stimulating critical problem solving in the quest for environmental innovations, social justice and sustainability.\",\"not more but different: a comment on the transitions research agenda. the sustainability transitions research network research agenda reflects the impressive growth and diversity of sustainability transitions scholarship, premised on an ethos of interdisciplinarity and openness to other research traditions and informed by increasingly diverse empirical case studies. nonetheless, an inclination to integrate concepts, ideas and logics from elsewhere into foundational core sustainability transitions research (str) frameworks (e.g. multi-level perspective, technological innovation systems) can be observed. this potentially constrains the development of new concepts, ideas and logics within transition research. we therefore stress the importance of theoretical pluralism and in particular of starting the analysis of transition processes from within alternative frameworks and working through transition processes with those frameworks on their own terms. the risks and opportunities of more radical theoretical pluralism in str are considered, and preliminary examples are presented from foucauldian and post/decolonial traditions.\",\"an assessment of the potential for spurring transformational change through nationally appropriate mitigation actions (namas). fulfilling the un paris agreement on climate change requires societal change at transformational scales, with associated challenges that are intensified in developing countries. in this context, nationally appropriate mitigation actions (namas) \\u2013 a key instrument in support of developing countries\\u2019 climate actions \\u2013 are promoted for their high theoretical transformative potential. however, little is known of how namas are related to transformation in practice. this article studies how developing countries intend to use the instrument to implement climate actions and whether these intentions are related to how transformation can be spurred at landscape, regime, and niche levels. 144 developing countries\\u2019 intended nationally determined contributions to the paris agreement are examined alongside 17 representative nama proposals. although there is scope to improve consideration of the instrument's theoretically high transformative potential in actual design, current practices indicate that spurring transformational change is already a high priority of nama designers.\",\"positioning of systemic intermediaries in sustainability transitions: between storylines and speech acts. how do systemic intermediaries obtain legitimate roles for themselves in innovation systems and transition processes? this is still an understudied question in the study of systemic intermediaries. we start from the observation that roles, or positions, are not given, but emerge in interactions as a negotiated set of rights and obligations. inspired by positioning theory, which has its roots in symbolic interactionism, we analyse how positions are invoked in the actors\\u2019 various actions and statements (\\u2018speech acts\\u2019) and how they draw from the mutually constructed narratives (\\u2018storylines\\u2019) that enable and constrain the range of possible positions. we analyse, over time, the positioning of three dutch systemic intermediaries in agriculture, energy production, and healthcare. we conclude that systemic intermediaries move together with the promise of the field and, as a consequence, have to reposition themselves. in different phases, they both profit and suffer from the dilemma between initiating and sustaining innovative systemic changes.\",\"religious agency in sustainability transitions: between experimentation, upscaling, and regime support. research in the field of sustainability transitions (sts) has significantly extended our knowledge of variables influencing these processes. however, the field so far has barely considered religion. the bourgeoning debate on religion and ecology (red), in contrast, highlights the potentials for religion to address environmental challenges. this article brings both academic debates together, systematizing and describing three types of religious agency from a transitions perspective: experimentation, upscaling, and regime support. these become manifest in st processes at two levels: (a) internal transitions within religious organizations and (b) broader societal sts. discussing transition activities of religious actors at these two levels, the article highlights the religious agency in sts, thereby contrasting existing transitions research where religion is often regarded as a passive landscape variable.\",\"transitioning the food system: a strategic practice management approach for cities. socio-technical systems are composed of everyday practices that are forged as they are performed in specific places. transitioning these systems toward sustainability involves changing the practices that constitute and reproduce them. this is true of the food system, which is enacted by the performance of activities, from food production to disposal, in specific communities. cities shape, support and normalize food practices, and in the process play an important role in transitioning the wider food system. the practice of shopping at farmers markets in nyc by recipients of federal food benefits illustrates how this and related practices are initiated, encouraged, coordinated, and enacted, and how corresponding shifts in the meanings, competences and material elements comprising a practice influence the food system. based on this case, the paper suggests opportunities for cities to engage in what we call strategic practice management to support shifts toward sustainable practices, and thus sustainable socio-technical systems.\",\"decolonising transitions in the global south: towards more epistemic diversity in transitions research. research on sustainability transitions in the global south has evolved since its inception a decade ago. yet, many issues concerning the hegemony of western knowledge systems and practices continue to impact research on transitions in the global south. this viewpoint suggests several ways to address these issues through decolonialising transitions research: namely through acknowledging everyday struggles faced in the global south, explicitly addressing questions of power, informal institutions, inequality and injustice that permeate transitions in the global south and integrating truly participatory research methods that value research \\u2018subjects\\u2019 and embrace the transformative activities and communities of practices. drawing on half a decade of formal and informal knowledges exchanges led by \\u201ctransitions in the global south\\u201d thematic group of strn, it is time for our community to embrace a fresh and alternative approach to understanding, mainstreaming and implementing transitions in the global south.\",\"psychology: the missing link in transitions research. in the next decade, transition researchers need to embrace perspectives, theories, and methods from the scientific field of psychology. an integrative research approach that covers the individual, group, and system level, executed in interdisciplinary research teams is necessary for more effective analysis and applications of sustainability transition processes.\",\"analyzing transitions through the lens of discourse networks: coal phase-out in germany. discourse analysis is gaining attention in transition studies. this paper uses discourse network analysis (dna) to study how discourse coalitions, and the storylines they mobilize, change over time. drawing from archival data of two daily newspapers, we analyze the struggle over coal phase-out in germany (2000\\u20132020). we identify an anti-coal discourse coalition, which was stable and ideationally congruent over time. it used climate change as the dominant storyline to delegitimize coal. the phase-out policy decision in 2020 can be interpreted as the success of this coalition. the pro-coal coalition, in contrast, was more dispersed and less consistent in their arguments. nonetheless, it was able to institutionalize some of their key storylines in the final policies. we argue that dna is a powerful tool we can mobilize in sustainability transitions research for the study of politics and beyond.\",\"earth system interventions as technologies of the anthropocene. earth system interventions (esis)\\u2014intentional large-scale interventions in earth systems\\u2014are not entirely new. however, in response to threats to sustainability, particularly from climate change and biodiversity loss, some scientists and others are researching, developing, and using new, largely technological esis. these include carbon dioxide removal, solar geoengineering, in situ genetically modified organisms, gene drive organisms, de-extinction, and high-tech ecosystem restoration. some emerging esis appear to be effective and feasible, both technically and economically, and may be necessary to achieve important sustainability and human welfare objectives. they also pose serious environmental risks. this paper identifies more than a dozen social, political, and ethical challenges that are common across many of the emerging technological esis. governance could mitigate and manage these issues, and it would be made more effective and robust by understanding and treating new esis as such and as a potentially transformative set of innovations in human-earth system relations.\",\"the geography of sustainability transitions: review, synthesis and reflections on an emergent research field. this review covers the recent literature on the geography of sustainability transitions and takes stock with achieved theoretical and empirical insights. the review synthesises and reflects upon insights of relevance for sustainability transitions following from analyses of the importance of place specificity and the geography of inter-organisational relations. it is found that these contributions focus on the geography of niche development rather than regime dynamics, and that there is an emphasis on understanding the importance of place-specificity at the local level. while there is a wide consensus that place-specificity matters there is still little generalisable knowledge about how place-specificity matters for transitions. most contributions add spatial sensitivity to frameworks from the transitions literature, but few studies suggest alternative frameworks to study sustainability transitions. to address this, the review suggests promising avenues for future research on the geography of sustainability transitions, drawing on recent theoretical advancements in economic geography.\",\"nature-based innovation systems. transitions literature regards technologies as critical components in shifting systems towards sustainability, which has informed the development of the technology-oriented technological innovation system (tis) framework. the emerging discourse on nature-based solutions (nbs) \\u2013 multifunctional nature-integrated spatial planning and design innovations \\u2013 raises the question to what extent tis can account for the development and diffusion of nbs. following a literature review, we present the nature-based innovation system (nbis) framework delineating critical factors for urban nature-based innovation. we find both commonalities and differences between tis and nbis, suggesting that the roles of place-based dynamics, agency and governance structure are more central to nature-based innovation, and market formation is more central to technological innovation. this has implications for the study of sustainability transitions, which has likely underplayed the potential of innovations at the nexus of socio-technical and socio-ecological systems. future research is needed to refine the nbis framework, for example by studying evolutionary developmental trajectories.\",\"learning for transitions: an experiential learning strategy for urban experiments. urban experimentation has been increasingly applied as an urban development tool for finding new ways to face grand societal challenges, as they unfold in cities. experiments might trigger systemic change, since they differ conceptually from conventional urban development, as they can be radical in ambition, limited in scope, and place emphasis on learning from real-world interventions. however, while there seems to be a common understanding of the importance of learning through urban experiments, there seems to remain a lack of, or unclarity on, learning and reflectivity in the practice of urban experimentation. this paper aims to provide principles for developing more explicit, testable, and improvable learning strategies in urban experimentation by addressing the following question: how to foster learning for transitions through urban experiments? for this, insights from transition studies and experiential learning theory (kolb, 1984) were used, resulting in a synthesized strategy for learning for transitions through experimentation.\",\"circular cities: mapping six cities in transition. urbanisation and climate change are urging cities to chart novel paths towards sustainable futures. many cities are turning to the alluring \\u2018circular economy\\u2019 (ce) concept to guide this redirection. the ce concept re-imagines how flows of resources moving through economies might be \\u2018closed\\u2019. here, we explore this new \\u2018circular city\\u2019 agenda by asking: how are cities adopting ce as a strategy?. we found that political leadership, building adaptable future visions, using experimental approaches (such as living labs), developing contextual knowledge about resource use, and engaging with diverse stakeholders to be important. however, we also expose that there is a lack of consensus on what a circular city constitutes and a need to further untangle the how and why of the circular city concept. the research contributes to the field by outlining emergent cases, identifying a set of common policy strategies, conceptualising a circular city and identifying areas for future research.\",\"the multi-level perspective on sustainability transitions: responses to seven criticisms. the multi-level perspective (mlp) has emerged as a fruitful middle-range framework for analysing socio-technical transitions to sustainability. the mlp also received constructive criticisms. this paper summarises seven criticisms, formulates responses to them, and translates these into suggestions for future research. the criticisms relate to: (1) lack of agency, (2) operationalization of regimes, (3) bias towards bottom-up change models, (4) epistemology and explanatory style, (5) methodology, (6) socio-technical landscape as residual category, and (7) flat ontologies versus hierarchical levels.\",\"passing the baton: how intermediaries advance sustainability transitions in different phases. recently, increasing attention has been paid to intermediaries, actors connecting multiple other actors, in transition processes. research has highlighted that intermediary actors (e.g. innovation funders, energy agencies, ngos, membership organisations, or internet discussion forums) operate in many levels to advance transitions. we argue that intermediation, and the need for it, varies during the course of transition. yet, little explicit insight exists on intermediation in different transition phases. we integrate existing conceptual models on transition dynamics and phases and a typology of transition intermediaries to examine how intermediaries advance transitions in different phases. we illustrate our conceptual insights through examples from car clubs, heat pumps and low-energy housing. we conclude that intermediation is paramount from predevelopment to stabilisation of a transition. intermediary functions change from supporting experimentation and articulation of needs in predevelopment, to the aggregation of knowledge, pooling resources, network building and stronger institutional support and capacity building in acceleration.\",\"exploring the possibilities for deliberately cultivating more effective ecologies of intermediation. sustainability transition studies acknowledge the importance of ecologies of intermediation for the acceleration of sustainability transitions and their governance. although some pioneering studies have already focused on analyzing these ecologies, further research is needed to understand the challenges of deliberately establishing ecologies in terms of processes and activities. to advance in this direction, this paper identifies three challenges based in empirical analysis of an initiative called \\u201cel d\\u00eda despu\\u00e9s\\u201d. through the case study, we analyze the challenges of: (a) enabling collaboration within the ecology and managing competition, (b) the dynamic context in which intermediation activities take place and (c) the composition of intermediaries in an ecology as the transition evolves. these challenges - and their relational positions between intermediaries, actors, networks and institutions - suggests a level of systemic intermediation additional to concepts in the literature currently. an additional role for intermediation is thus identified, namely, ecology intermediation.\",\"governing translocal experimentation in multi-sited transition programs: dynamics and challenges. transition experiments are important instruments to foster sustainability transitions. transition scholars increasingly suggest investigating how multiple local experiments can become connected across spatial scales, and how transformative dynamics of multiple connected experiments can be facilitated and governed. in this paper we analyze the different types of translocal dynamics involved in simultaneously governing multiple experiments in multi-sited transition programs, by empirically exploring the fit4food2030 program (2017-2020) that supported 25 transition experiments. then, we present four overarching challenges in governing translocal experimentation: (1) finding synergies between diverging local needs and program ambitions; (2) navigating the cross-scale political dynamics in multi-sited transition programs; (3) moving beyond output-oriented evaluation frameworks in order to capture transformative efforts of short-term programs; and (4) expanding the boundaries of programs by linking to ongoing policy developments in highly complex multi-level governance settings. we hope our work can inform transition governance efforts in fostering transformative translocal dynamics toward sustainability.\",\"learning from success - toward evidence-informed sustainability transitions in communities. driven by concerns over the long-term viability and integrity of their communities people around the world initiate transitions toward sustainability on various levels of society. a particular segment of these initiatives are in small, place-based communities. each initiative presents learning opportunities to build robust transitions that may contribute to progress toward a sustainable society in general. little empirical research has been conducted on how the transition context and process lead to particular outcomes. this article presents an analytical-evaluative framework for appraising the sustainability of transition outcomes and reconstructing transition pathways in order to identify critical success factors. ashton hayes in the u.k. serves as an illustrative case study. the framework may be used for planning and design of transitions, as well as for conducting cross-case comparisons on how transitions work. the ultimate goal is to derive, accumulated over many studies, evidence-informed guidelines to improve the effectiveness of transitions.\",\"a framework to explain the role of boundary objects in sustainability transitions. our modern society is characterized by increasing diversity and complexity, leading to overwhelming challenges like climate change or environmental degradation. these problems are posing impracticable ethical dilemmas and conflicts of interest among an expanding range of institutional logics. while this cognitive, ideological, scientific, and political diversity can represent a major barrier for the collaborative work that sustainability transitions require, it is also a necessary resource for innovation and adaptation. it is then natural to wonder how diversity and collaboration among institutional logics can be accommodated and balanced. in this article, we develop a framework to explain the role of boundary objects in sustainability transitions (boist framework), which describes how ambiguous artefacts (boundary objects) can be deliberately employed by actors to drive transitions through bridging conflicting logics without constraining their diversity. the applicability of the framework is demonstrated with an in-depth case study of the copenhagen municipality's transition to more sustainable stormwater management.\",\"the role of inter-sectoral dynamics in sustainability transitions: a comment on the transitions research agenda. building on the chapter \\u201cbusinesses and industries in sustainability transitions\\u201d in the strn agenda, this viewpoint calls for more attention to how economic and environmental goals can be aligned to enhance the political legitimacy of transitions. this requires, we suggest, a more integrated understanding of the relationship between industrial transformation and sustainability transitions. we provide a tentative articulation of such a perspective by recombining insights from the fields of industrial dynamics and transition studies. we point to three issues that can serve as starting points for developing such a perspective and argue why those merit more attention in transition studies. these include: (a) attention to the diversity of sectors and firms involved in, and affected by, transitions through inter-sectoral linkages, (b) how existing knowledge bases influence the direction and scope of transitions, and (c) policy challenges associated with parallel transitions in multiple sectors that constitute economy-wide processes of structural change.\",\"analyzing sustainability transitions as a shift between socio-metabolic regimes. this essay seeks to specify the theoretical choices and assumptions involved in studying sociometabolic transitions, such as sustainability transitions, in a way that distinguishes them from mere \\\"changes\\\". these generalizations draw on experiences with the

of transitions in space: diverging trajectories of electric mobility and autonomous driving in urban and rural settlement structures. how does the spatial context shape early innovation trajectories and how will this influence the directionality of transitions? we elaborate these questions for the case of transitions in personal mobility, focusing on emerging trajectories of electric vehicles and autonomous driving. we analyze how the dynamics depend on whether innovation and transition strategies are primarily geared towards urban or rural contexts. in order to identify potentially diverging trajectories, we specify socio-technical regime structures at two levels: the level of service regimes (i.e. rules that relate to specific means of transport, like the car) and the level of the sectoral regime (i.e. rules that regulate the interplay between the different service regimes). we will show that depending on whether the early innovation strategies are oriented at rural or urban contexts, quite different directionalities can result both regarding the technological trajectory of the new service option, but also regarding the overall sector configuration.\",\"explaining variance in national electric vehicle policies. transition studies\\u2019 understanding of differences in public policy is limited due to its tendency to focus on single-country cases. this paper assesses differences in plug-in electric vehicle (pev) policies, comprising rd&d subsidies, infrastructure investments and sales incentives, across 13 countries over the period 2008\\u20132014. i explore three conditions that may influence these policy expenditures. content and statistical analyses show that national pev policies differed drastically across countries in intensity and orientation, ranging from a focus on supply-side innovation policy to a focus on demand-side environmental policy. the government's role across national political economies only explain differences in pev infrastructure investments, while the government's pev diffusion targets for 2020 surprisingly do not correlate with any pev policy. economic interest in the car industry shows and explains why car countries focus their policy on technology development, and non-car countries on technology diffusion. these findings enhance the understanding of national policies in transitions.\",\"experimenting with a circular business model: lessons from eight cases. experimentation is an important capability in the transition to a sustainable business. the aim of business experimentation is to learn and improve business model innovation activities with limited risks and resources through continuous and collective learning with stakeholders. through action research we worked with eight case companies on a pathway to becoming a sustainable business. we focused on \\u2018circular economy\\u2019 as a driver for sustainability. the process and role of business model experimentation were analysed. a circular business experimentation framework was developed and applied. we found that 1) experimentation creates internal and external engagement to start business sustainability transitions 2) experiments can help test assumptions in every building block of the business model 3) collaboration with external partners can ease experimentation, and 4) experimentation processes are iterative and require regular learning and sustainability checks. further research is necessary to analyse how sustainability targets can be integrated into the experimentation process.\",\"an organizational view on transport transitions involving new mobility concepts and changing customer behavior. the integration of electric, shared and autonomous vehicles is shaping new forms of mobility and ultimately the future of the entire automotive industry. our study addresses the ongoing shift in values and individual customer demand that has to be met by providing innovative concepts for future transport. we call into question what challenges arise when new technological developments and complex societal changes need to be aligned in a socio-technical system. our qualitative approach is based on the use of semi-structured interviews with representatives from a traditional car manufacturer. by investigating the expectations and actions from an organizational perspective we find important predictions concerning the inevitable changes in customer behavior and organizational strategy. it becomes clear that one of the key challenges is an appropriate steering system to motivate innovation activities and enhance creativity within the organization in order to ensure long-term success in an increasingly competitive market environment.\",\"mapping the governing entities and their interactions in designing policy mixes for sustainability transitions: the case of electric vehicles in china. recognising the limited consideration of administrative aspects in sustainability transitions research, this article investigates the governing entities behind china's policy mix for electric vehicles (evs), and their interactions from 2001 to 2020. based on a social network analysis of policy documents we find that as the e-mobility transition unfolds, a complex and evolving network of governing entities has appeared in designing china's ev policy mix. specifically, a small group of highly interactive governing entities has played a critical role in coordinating and mobilising system resources, while some new entrants have also come to the fore in response to recent socio-technical changes. moreover, our community detection analysis distinguishes various groups of governing entities, each performing different policy functions. based on our empirical case, we discuss factors that influence changes to administrative arrangements for policy mixes. we conclude that the deliberate acceleration of sustainability transitions calls for further research on the administration of the associated policy mixes.\",\"moving small crafts and services enterprises towards green mobility practices: the role of change agents. the uptake of electric vans in professional enterprises has been slow, and the interest in electric mobility is low compared to that of private consumers. to understand critical barriers, resistance, motivations and drivers we follow the implementation of e-vans (evs) in crafts and services enterprises that have tried to replace some or all of their traditional vans with evs. based on a social practice approach we show how and why the new technology challenged existing work practices in the enterprises, and took hold in some enterprises while being rejected in others. we recognize the significant role of managers as \\u201cagents of practice change\\u201d in initiating changes and stabilizing social practice configurations. the findings add to the literature on social practice change and document critical factors for further implementation and use of e-vans in crafts and services enterprises.\",\"transitions as a coevolutionary process: the urban emergence of electric vehicle inventions. this paper combines a multi-sectoral approach with a perspective on the geography of transitions. the concept of coevolution is used to bridge these contributions as it allows to see mutual influences and adaptation between sectors while acknowledging spatial embeddedness and its economic, institutional and social aspects. the argument is discussed using the case of the transition to electric vehicles (evs) and the connections between three technologies: ev, battery, and smart grid. patent citations are used to construct three main paths allowing to geolocate key inventions and to elaborate on the role of cities in supporting knowledge recombination. the case study suggests that a coevolutionary perspective can contribute to understanding the geography of transitions in three ways: by relating emerging socio-technical configurations to changed power relations and opportunities along the value chain, by exposing the spatial embeddedness of interdependent sectors and by clarifying the role of actors and networks.\",\"using dynamic capabilities to shape markets for alternative technologies: a comparative case study of automotive incumbents. this paper analyzes how incumbent firms act to shape markets for new technology alternatives. it introduces a framework that highlights important linkages between the dynamic market-shaping capabilities of individual firms and market-shaping processes on a system level. the framework is used to analyze the endeavors of two large heavy vehicle manufacturers to introduce two technology platforms\\u2014electrified trucks and trucks fueled by liquefied gas\\u2014as alternatives to traditional diesel-fueled trucks. the analysis shows how incumbent firms deploy market-shaping capabilities to claim legitimate positions in envisioned future markets. the paper concludes by pointing to the dynamism of market interactions in sustainability transitions, showing how firms induce system-level reconfigurations and how such reconfigurations induce changes at the level of the firm.\",\"electrifying the automotive industry: the geography and governance of r&d collaboration. the automotive industry is subject to various pressures that may result in a transition to more eco-friendly technologies. electrified vehicles represent a potential means to shift road transport onto a new technological path. however, incumbent automakers face several challenges related to vehicle electrification. one challenge is that vehicle electrification requires competences different to those associated with the internal combustion engine. automakers can access competences and knowledge that can benefit innovation via collaborative r&dwith external organisations. this paper uses patent and bibliometric data to examine geographical and organisational aspects of r&d collaboration in the automotive industry. we distinguish between two modes of organisation for r&d collaborations between automakers and external partners (hierarchies and networks) and compare r&d collaborations for electric vehicle technologies with traditional r&d partnerships. we show that automakers collaborate with foreign partners when they are linked viahierarchies and are embedded in local r&d networks with academic partners.\",\"transformative versus conservative automotive innovation styles: contrasting the electric vehicle manufacturing strategies for the bmw i3 and fiat 500e. the automotive industry is a critically important stakeholder influencing the sustainability of passenger transport. how traditional car manufacturers respond to carbon reduction and vehicle targets, alongside other selection pressures, can greatly influence the availability and affordability of new innovations such as electric vehicles. in this paper, we explore the automotive innovation styles surrounding two electric vehicles: the bmw i3, and the fiat 500e. to do so, we tie together ideas from technological innovation systems and corporate product innovation style. our results illustrate a case of a \\u201ccompliance car,\\u201d the fiat 500e, vs. the first mass production ev by a major german car manufacturer, the bmw i3. bmw adheres to a transformative change-shaping innovation style that attempts to promote in-house learning that can create value. fiat adheres to a conservative sustaining innovation style that attempts to outsource innovation, promotes limited learning, and focuses on maintaining value. both styles interestingly result in converging product development patterns over time.\",\"eu industrial policy: between modernization and transformation of the automotive industry. the transport sector accounts for 27 % of total co2 emissions in the eu, with almost half of these being attributed to passenger cars and the automotive industry. in order to meet the paris agreement 1.5 \\u00b0c target, these figures call for interventionist policies that go beyond individual consumer choice and transform industrial sectors. the article conceptually elaborates on the advancements in transformation and transition studies to analyse the role of industrial policy for accelerating social-ecological transformations. the article empirically analyses key characteristics of eu industrial policy and critically discusses its potential for transforming the automotive sector, based on a qualitative case study of the austrian automotive (supplier) industry. our analysis suggests that eu industrial policies at most ecologically modernise and at worst actively conserve the unsustainable structures of the automotive industry. this is because eu automotive industrial policies (1) defend economic growth and competitiveness, (2) focus narrowly on innovation (policy) and refuse to disrupt unsustainable industrial pathways as well as (3) promote ecological modernisation through efficiency instead of absolute emission reductions. the article concludes with entry points for a transformative industrial policy beyond ecological modernisation.\",\"cycling as a service assessed from a combined business-model and transitions perspective. cycling-based mobility services or 'cycling as a service' (caas) have recently expanded in number and scale in the netherlands. in contrast to the contexts of most other caas studies to date, cycling has a high modal share and strong institutions in the dutch context. however, these supportive features have not translated into straightforward success for caas providers. instead, responses to caas providers have varied widely, from tolerance to opposition. in this study we employ a combined business model and transition perspective to investigate this variation and its implications for caas in dutch urban mobility systems. we present value propositions derived from business models, and integrate these into hoogma's fit-and-stretch strategy framework for emerging niches. this enables a comparison between technology design and value propositions, and an analysis of the caas niche's transitions potential. our findings clarify the strategies used by niche actors to enter and operate within established cycling regimes.\",\"the value chain dilemma of navigating sustainability transitions: a case study of an upstream incumbent company. an increasing body of literature on sustainability transitions addresses the business strategies of incumbents but overlooks upstream companies. by addressing this gap, we aim to explore how upstream incumbents navigate sustainability transitions. theoretically, we introduce an industry value chain perspective, integrating the concepts of center of gravity, patterns of strategic change and organizational adaptation. empirically, we conduct an in-depth case study of how an upstream incumbent firm navigates the established value chain for lead-acid batteries and the emerging value chain for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. the company faces a dilemma as to whether and how to maintain a vertically integrated position in the established value chain, and how and when to expand into the emerging value chain. we argue and demonstrate that for upstream companies, navigating sustainability transitions is highly dependent on the anticipation of and adaptation to the complex changes in industry value chains.\",\"business model innovation as a process for transforming user mobility practices. the notion that business models can play a critical role in sociotechnical transitions and bring about sustainable reorientations of existing systems has received increasing attention. changes to social practices are also fundamental to such transformations yet are poorly understood. in this paper, we examine the possibility that business model innovation can affect changes to user practices associated with personal mobility. based on an interview study with 21 car sharing operators in four nordic countries, we show that experimentation with different elements of car sharing business models has the potential to change user practices by modifying their elements, by recruiting new practitioners, and by creating linkages between otherwise separate user practices.\",\"contested visions and sociotechnical expectations of electric mobility and vehicle-to-grid innovation in five nordic countries. based on original data derived from 257 expert respondents across denmark, finland, iceland, norway, and sweden, we investigate the different expectations and visions associated with one form of low carbon transport, electric mobility, inclusive of vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-grid-integration configurations. utilizing concepts from the sociology of expectation\\u2014notably rhetorical visions, ideographs, promise-requirement cycles, and enablers and selectors\\u2014we examine how future electric mobility is envisioned. a collection of eight visions is analyzed and then placed into a typology. some visions see electric mobility as a harbinger of positive social change in terms of ubiquitous automobility or endless innovation, others warn of families literally stranded and freezing to death on mountains and a business landscape marred with insolvent and financially struggling firms. we conclude with insights about what such competing and contradictory visions mean for energy and climate policy as well as sustainability transitions.\",\"a choreography of delay: the response of german auto incumbents to environmental policy. most serious environmental and health problems caused by the transport sector stem from the automobile. while other sectors have reduced emissions, transport emissions have increased and the sector's sustainability transformation seems stalled. why is that? and what role do incumbent automobile industry actors play? relatively few scholars have focused on the behavior of these incumbents. our study contributes towards filling this gap by analyzing two case studies of how the german automobile industry has reacted to environmental policy initiatives. our analysis allows us to make several contributions to the literature. first, we demonstrate how industry and policy makers attempted to outmaneuver each other. second, we illuminate several tactics employed by incumbents to resist change. and third, our analysis reveals a pattern of behavior that we argue is linked to the degree of pressure placed on incumbents. most other attempts to identify patterns have prioritized the temporal dimension.\",\"systems of practice and the circular economy: transforming mobile phone product service systems. of late, policy and research attention has increasingly focused on making the circular economy a reality. a key part of this agenda is the creation of sustainable product service systems (spss) that meet consumers\\u2019 needs whilst lessening negative environmental impacts. although the spss literature has grown recently, key aspects require further examination. in response, this paper discusses empirical research exploring consumers\\u2019 reactions to a novel, hypothetical mobile phone spss, utilizing qualitative methods that included \\u2018business origami\\u2019. it examines consumers\\u2019 knowledge about current mobile phone life cycles, and responses to the proposed spss, drawing on a \\u2018systems of practice\\u2019 framework to discuss the potential for significant changes in phone purchase and use. it outlines barriers to alterations in practices, underscoring the centrality that connectivity and data storage now have in many peoples\\u2019 daily lives, which have for some become clustered around the capabilities and accessibility of the mobile phone.\",\"the rise of china's new energy vehicle lithium-ion battery industry: the coevolution of battery technological innovation systems and policies. in recent decades, the technological innovation systems (tis) framework has been applied to the study of technology development and diffusion. while policy is considered a key element of tis analysis, less attention has been paid to the influence of tis dynamics on policymaking. to better understand the coevolution between tis and policies, this paper develop an analytical framework to highlight the coevolution between tis dynamics and policymaking. the framework underlines not only the influence of policies on tis functionality, but also that changes in tis functionality may in turn feed back into policymaking: policymakers may observe changes in tis functionality and adjust policies to account for this, but changes in tis functionality may also have implications for the ability of tis actors to influence policymaking. empirically, we study the new energy vehicle battery (nevb) industry in china since the early 2000s. in the case of china's nevb industry, an increasingly strong and complicated coevolutionary relationship between the focal tis and relevant policies at different levels of abstraction can be observed. overall, we argue that more research is needed to better understand the agency side of how tis development leads to changes in policymaking.\",\"actor rationales in sustainability transitions - interests and expectations regarding electric vehicle recharging. in this paper i ask the question why actors support socio-technical transitions and take part in niche activities. the analysis starts from the hypothesis that strategic rationales of these actors vary and that these depend on their interests and expectations in relation to the emerging system. i pay special attention to their desire to influence the technological and institutional configuration of the emerging socio-technical system. i draw from a case study on the transition towards electric automobility in the netherlands. from the analysis, eight strategic rationales for taking part in niche activities are distilled. these go to show that it is not only a straightforward positive interest that motivates niche actors. however, the support from these actors is conditional and they are likely to end their support as soon as the emerging system no longer aligns with their interests.\",\"origin of car enthusiasm and alternative paths in history. how can we explain the formidable success of the car all over the world? it is suggested here that the historical origin is key to the root of this enthusiasm. from a climate change mitigation perspective car culture is a difficult problem, but why is that so? this paper presents a framework of interpretation based on the literature of the birth of the american car culture about one hundred years ago. agency, not the least on the part of the user, technological choice, and industrial links are emphasized and put together in a framework called \\u201cforks and links\\u201d. this framework is tested as a narrative in the second part of the paper. it is argued that the car belongs to a product category with which active users can change their lives, while fuel and propulsion is just an input. a desired capacity for touring was decisive in the choice between gasoline and electric cars.\",\"shifting gears on sustainable transport transitions: stakeholder perspectives on e-bikes in toronto, canada. car-centric transportation systems are widely regarded as unsustainable. e-bikes are an emerging technology with potential to strengthen sustainability transitions. little is known about the role of governance stakeholders in shaping e-bike technology uptake/rejection. this qualitative study draws upon theories of socio-technical transitions, disruptive technology and strategic niche management to interrogate transportation governance stakeholders\\u2019 perceptions towards e-bikes and related prospects or barriers to enhancing sustainability in canada's most populated, congested city. e-bikes possess niche benefits that help encourage socio-technical shift away from cars. yet their greatest potential in strengthening transition pathways may be their ability to enhance seamless, multi-modal transportation through incorporation into transit hubs and shared mobility systems. e-bikes also pose negative disruptions that undermine their uptake. the range of models on the market warrant greater regulatory distinction according to unique characteristics and hazards. e-bike governance requires further coordination, and decision-makers need more data on usage patterns and modal displacement.\",\"sustainable business model innovation and scaling through collaboration. over the past decade, scholars and practitioners have increasingly paid attention to sustainable business models (sbm). how to upscale sbms is a key question in transition research, but current research has rarely adopted a firm-level perspective to discuss the scaling strategies that initiators of sbms can use. collaboration with other actors is one of these scaling strategies, but its adoption by firms hinges on different factors. considering the type of initiator of the sbm (newcomer vs. incumbent firm) and the differentiation of the sbm's value proposition (high or low), we propose a framework which distinguishes four \\u2018scaling-through-collaboration\\u2019 strategies that firms can use. we explain each strategy with illustrative examples and discuss the array of potential partners and the incentives to pursue collaboration with them. our work shows how firms can contribute to sustainability transitions by leveraging collaboration to scale their sbm.\",\"on the verge of change: maverick innovation with mobility scooters. mobility scooter users provide a practical means through which to better understand socio-technical mobility and low-carbon transitions. the paper offers insights into how socio-technical low-carbon transitions can be influenced by peripheral, disruptive and unanticipated niche-innovations. the article reports on original empirical work conducted with mobility scooter users in a car dependent city, and the ways they negotiate a fossil-fuelled transport system designed for automobiles. concepts from the multi-level perspective (mlp) are applied to better understand how the individual efforts of mobility scooter users conceived as \\u2018mavericks\\u2019 form a consensus of local practices (or \\u2018practice-consensus\\u2019) in early processes of \\u2018niche\\u2019 innovations. in doing so, insights are offered into how maverick experimentation and innovation within the automobile transport regime help understand different drivers of transition, specifically \\u2018mobility justice\\u2019 sustainability and commercial interests.\",\"are battery electric vehicles the future? an uncertainty comparison with hydrogen and combustion engines. road transport remains to be one of germany's main obstacles to effective greenhouse gas emissions reduction. even though the climate ambition is clear, disagreement about the preference of alternative low-carbon drive technologies for road transport persist to this day. while uncertainty is a main reason for this disagreement it has been largely ignored in the comparison of the three main options: battery electric vehicles, vehicles with hydrogen-based fuel cell, and vehicles with internal combustion engine based on decarbonized fuels. by combining argument mapping with uncertainty analysis we identify, characterize and compare the uncertainties on germany's energy transition of road transport. we find that all drive technologies are affected by a similar number and quality of uncertainties. our results emphasize why any final drive technology preference is still unjustified and why all options should be advanced alongside each other to avoid lock-in decisions.\",\"e-scooter regulation: the micro-politics of market-making for micro-mobility in bergen. micro-mobility market-making represents an under-studied but important aspect of urban transport sustainability transitions. micro-mobility roll-out combines several critical elements: decarbonisation, digitalisation and public space interventions. we theorise the emergence of a micro-mobility market, drawing on innovation studies, micro-politics scholarship and commoning mobility literature, and critically discuss the relationship between innovation and regulation in this emerging market. we examine e-scooter roll-out in bergen, norway, using a structured analysis that interrogates knowledge, authority and power. our empirical analysis employs expert interviews and focus group discussions with key transport sector stakeholders, including policymakers, practitioners and urban residents. we discuss insights in terms of implications for how micro-mobility markets are made and in turn make urban transport sustainability transitions. we argue that while micro-mobility can enable just low-carbon mobility transitions, market forces drive outcomes that may undermine urban sustainability agendas. we identify scope for dynamic regulation to engender low-carbon mobility in wider public interest.\",\"factors behind sustainable business innovation: the case of a global carpet manufacturing company. innovation is critical to business. sustainability is a global challenge requiring innovation. many organizations have publicly committed to innovate towards environmental, social and economic sustainability, but a behaviour gap remains. in order to promote the effectiveness of these endeavours, there is a pressing need to understand the conditions for successful innovation towards sustainability, backed by empirical evidence. this paper complements prior work by developing a definition of sustainability-oriented innovation (building upon definitions of eco-innovation), and by discussing observations of this activity in practice. the paper presents an account of sustainability-oriented innovation at interface, a global manufacturing company with radical sustainability goals. it expounds the contexts in which these innovations arose, focusing in particular on net-works, a radical, socially-minded fishing-net recycling programme. it was found that several unique factors contributed to success: adopting an existing route to market, partnering with an ngo, and learning from mistakes in a \\u201csafe failure space\\u201d.\",\"analysing the potential for sustainable e-mobility - the case of germany. the current momentum in the electrification of the car fuels hope for a transition in mobility. however, electric vehicles have failed before and it is thus asked: what is the potential of e-mobility developing as a sustainable system innovation? in order to deal with this challenge analytically, a theoretical framework is developed: the concepts of transformative capacity of a new technology (do electric vehicles trigger 'social' innovations, e.g. new business models or use patterns?) and system adaptability (how stable is the mobility regime?) are introduced and the issue of sustainability is discussed. this framework will be explored for the german innovation system for e-mobility. it can be shown that electric cars will only be successful when part of a system innovation and that the german innovation system is dominated by regime actors and thus potentially used as a way to fend off more substantial change.\",\"dinosaurs in transition? a conceptual exploration of local incumbents in the swiss and german energy transition. the understanding of incumbents\\u2019 behaviour in sustainability transitions in the energy sector is gaining increasing scholarly attention. however, two key structural characteristics of many incumbents in the energy sector are hardly taken into account: they are mostly public companies and they are operating in infrastructure network industries. furthermore, studies on incumbents in the energy sector do not consider the multi-scalar situation of federal energy governance systems, as in germany and switzerland. this paper presents six analytical categories, which reveal the specifics of public energy companies and provide categories for a more precise analysis. they are developed through an iterative theory building process, combining empirical evidence from urban utility companies in germany and switzerland and theoretical insights from public corporate governance and network industries literature. finally, the paper discusses, how these categories can be linked to the triple embeddedness framework (geels, 2014) and transferred to other infrastructure sectors (e.g. the telecommunication or the railway sector) to enrich the understanding of public incumbents in sustainability transitions.\",\"how do we govern sustainable innovations? mapping patterns of governance for biofuels and hybrid-electric vehicle technologies. this paper examines patterns of governance aimed at sustainable technological innovation in the transport sector. it makes an overall assessment of governance emerging in the fields of biofuel and hybrid-electric vehicle (hev) technologies, and makes a classification of its characteristics. it examines the role of different actors and levels of governance as well as preferred mechanisms and targets of governance. the assessment reveals that there are rather differential patterns of governance influencing the two fields. for instance, international-level and market-based governance are much more prevalent in biofuels, whereas industry-led and cognitive governance play comparatively stronger roles in hev. these patterns can be understood in light of both the different institutional and actor characteristics of the two technologies, and their positions in relation to socio-technical regimes.\",\"mobility and environmental impacts of car sharing in the netherlands. this research aims to quantify the effects of car sharing on car ownership, car use and co2 emissions. the results are based on a survey amongst 363 car sharing respondents in the netherlands. we found over 30% less car ownership amongst car sharers and they drove 15% to 20% fewer car kilometres than prior to car sharing. the shared cars mostly replace a second or third car. due to reduced car ownership and car use, car sharers emit between 240 and 390 fewer kilograms of co2 per person, per year. this is between 13% and 18% of the co2 emissions related to car ownership and car use.\",\"why do companies\\u2019 institutional strategies differ across cities? a cross-case analysis of bike sharing in shanghai & amsterdam. bike sharing has the potential to contribute to more sustainable urban mobility. companies providing this service need to generate legitimacy for their venture when entering new cities. they may have to change formal and informal institutions in cities they want to operate. in this paper we explore how and why companies\\u2019 institutional strategies differ across cities. we compare strategies of emerging free-floating bike sharing companies in shanghai and amsterdam. these cities provide a counterintuitive starting point: shanghai is a car-dominant city which has embraced bike sharing, whereas in amsterdam \\u2013 a typical cycling city \\u2013 it was banned soon after its introduction. we find that companies use similar launching strategies, but different institutional strategies as they respond to varying spatial conditions consisting of local institutions (e.g. rules, norms and cultures) physical place specific elements (e.g. infrastructures and urban mobility challenges) and issues of power (e.g. support and resistance).\",\"are scenarios of hydrogen vehicle adoption optimistic? a comparison with historical analogies. there is a large literature exploring possible hydrogen futures, using various modelling and scenario approaches. this paper compares the rates of transition depicted in that literature with a set of historical analogies. these analogies are cases in which alternative-fuelled vehicles have penetrated vehicle markets. the paper suggests that the literature has tended to be optimistic about the possible rate at which hydrogen vehicles might replace oil-based transportation. the paper compares 11 historical adoptions of alternative fuel vehicles with 24 scenarios from 20 studies that depict possible hydrogen futures. all but one of the hydrogen scenarios show vehicle adoption faster than has occurred for hybrid electric vehicles in japan, the most successful market for hybrids. several scenarios depict hydrogen transitions occurring at a rate faster than has occurred in any of the historic examples. the paper concludes that scenarios of alternative vehicle adoption should include more pessimistic scenarios alongside optimistic ones.\",\"where is the politics? e-bike mobility in urban china and civilizational government. in this study we look at everyday politics of electric bike mobility by exploring the social practices of e-bike users in order to understand the role of e-bikes in emerging low-carbon mobility system in china, asking \\u2018where is the politics of the e2w in contemporary china?\\u2019 we explore the underlying political tensions in electric two-wheeler mobility by examining family and informal e-bike journeys. we argue that \\u2018civilizational\\u2019 government perspective provides a new way of thinking about politics of mobility and system transition in china.\",\"assessing and comparing german and uk transition policies for electric mobility. this paper presents a novel policy assessment approach for sustainable transitions using insights from the multilevel perspective (mlp). an analysis of current german and uk policies for sustainable transport is conducted to illustrate its application. for both cases a potential transition pathway, that can satisfy environmental protection and industrial competitiveness goals, is derived from archetypal transition pathways. these are then put in relation to current policies, discussing whether these measures support these pathways. in the uk case, where emission reduction goals and industrial development are pursued together, current policies of promoting the diffusion of electric vehicles as well as industrial niches are supporting the emergence of a reconfiguration pathway. replacing foreign suppliers, the local automotive industry shall become a significant part of the future regime. in contrast to that, germany focuses on a careful transformation and conservation of its automotive industry where none of the current actors is left behind.\",\"low-carbon innovation from a hydroelectric base: the case of electric vehicles in qu\\u00e9bec. this article explores the transformative potential of hydroelectricity by examining interactions with electric vehicle (ev) technologies in qu\\u00e9bec, canada. it finds that structural features of qu\\u00e9bec's hydroelectric regime enabled qu\\u00e9bec's ev technological innovation system. organizational and institutional characteristics of the socio-technical environment shaped by qu\\u00e9bec's history of hydroelectric development played a particularly important role in promoting political legitimacy and early-stage ev innovation processes, such as knowledge development and exchange. while the technical complements between hydro and ev could lead to significant ghg reductions, technical overlaps between the two technologies were less responsible for initiating the momentum needed to build an ev innovation system. qu\\u00e9bec's social history of hydroelectricity development provides actors with important resources for the development of ev technologies.\",\"from 'freedom of the open road' to 'cocooning': understanding resistance to change in personal private automobility. this review paper takes the perspective of cultures of automobility in an historical context to understand resistance to attempts to alter the personal automobility paradigm with more sustainable alternative mobility concepts. the paper seeks to urge caution upon those that identify 'peak car' or an imminent socio-technical transition to sustainable mobility and a re-emergence of public transportation modes. the paper argues that cars as cultural objects have shifted from embodying the ideological philosophy of personal freedom to that of cocooning. in so doing the paper seeks to inject a note of caution into the debate over emergent post-automobility societies through reflection on the character and impact of cultures of automobility. despite the possible declining functionality of cars as a means of transport, it is concluded that their appeal as personal space remains and may even be enhanced by future technological changes.\",\"the competitive environment of electric vehicles: an analysis of prototype and production models. this study analyzes the industrial dynamics of electric vehicles using product life cycle and eco-innovation concepts. a unique database of approximately 450 electric vehicle prototype and production models from 1991 to 2011 was collected and analyzed. this research largely focused on three factors that become fluid during a transitional era of ferment (the technology, the set of firms and the target market). results show that since 2004, the number of companies producing electric vehicle (ev) models has substantially increased with startup firms comprising a majority of that growth. the variety of battery types used in ev models has expanded, largely through lithium-ion chemistries. large incumbents and startup firms have targeted different consumer markets with their ev models. startup firms developed ev models for niche markets (sports cars and low speed vehicles) while large incumbents generally developed ev models that are more in line with current customer demands.\",\"perspectives on norway's supercharged electric vehicle policy. norway has achieved an unprecedented breakthrough for battery electric vehicles. the market share reached 17.1% in 2015, and the total fleet passed 2.7%, some 70000 vehicles. the multilevel perspective framework demonstrate how norwegian incentives and policies gradually developed over a 25 year period through interactions between the international landscape, national governance networks, regimes and niches. actors have been able to utilize windows of opportunities leading to the potential establishment of a bev regime assimilated into the ice regime from 2016. bev incentives, some of which have been in place since 1990, did not yield results until the traditional vehicle manufacturers manufactured bevs based on li-ion batteries from 2010. norwegian purchase incentives are large enough to make electric vehicles a competitively priced alternative for vehicle buyers. increased selection of models, improved technology, reduced vehicle prices, and extensive marketing have spurred further sales.\",\"the evolution of cooperative electric carsharing in germany and the role of intermediaries. citizen projects for electric carsharing are a relatively recent phenomenon in germany which can contribute to the sustainable transition of existing mobility regimes. this article aims to outline the status quo of electric carsharing cooperatives in germany, explore the niche-conditions in which such projects can develop and analyze intermediate mechanisms which promote their geographical dissemination. success of cooperative e-carsharing projects depends on a dedicated volunteer group for project management as well as local and extra-local linkages to policy makers, other cooperatives and potential users. different, mutually exclusive structures of disseminating cooperative e-carsharing projects are being established. this article argues, that intermediate structures of citizen projects not only act as facilitators of project-related knowledge but can also evolve as integrated systems for the provision of service portfolios.\",\"evaluating co2 reduction policy mixes in the automotive sector. this paper presents an agent-based model that simulates the market for passenger cars in which firm strategies, market structure, consumer choices and policy instruments co-evolve. the main contribution of the paper is to explore the ways in which mixes of heterogeneous policy instruments impact on economic and technological decisions of firms, consumers' purchase decisions, global co2 emissions and public finance. we exhibit how the dynamics of the system can lead to a technological lock-in into internal combustion technologies and demonstrate the ways in which policy instruments can help to break this lock-in. we address the complementary, synergetic or contrasting effects between policy instruments. we show that policy mixes can be relevant to achieve the best of different stand-alone policy instruments, but not necessarily all policy mixes. ex ante evaluation is therefore recommended.\",\"temporal echoes and cross-geography policy effects: multiple levels of transition governance and the electric vehicle breakthrough. this article analyses the norwegian electric vehicle transition from a socio-technical perspective, shedding light on the emergence of one of the most important ev markets globally. the norwegian strategy to promote this transition is often understood as a set of targeted policies to create ev demand. here, we illustrate how visions and incentives for a norwegian ev transition have emerged over a period of 40 years, highlighting how many of the incentives were actually introduced as mechanisms to stimulate the creation of a norwegian ev industry niche. conceptually, we contribute to understandings of the complex geographies of niche creation through discussions of how local policies can have trans-local and global effects. further, we identify dynamics we describe as temporal echoes, which illustrate how visions, strategies or policies introduced at a specific point in time to serve a particular purpose might unexpectedly re-appear later, transformed, to serve different purposes.\",\"environmental and health aspects of mobile phone production and use: suggestions for innovation and policy. mobile phones are universally popular due to their convenience. but their production and use can cause various environmental, energy and health effects. the present study addresses the adverse effects of mobile phones, and proposed remedies to overcome them. it pays special attention to the role of technical innovation. it is suggested that governments and the mobile telecommunication industry need to work together to develop realistic and effective regulations for design, manufacture, energy consumption, recycling and reuse of mobile phones so as to mitigate and minimize the various negative impacts.\",\"niche aggregation through cumulative learning: a study of multiple electric bus projects. this paper seeks to answer the question of how learning processes support niche aggregation. it brings together literature on strategic niche management and theoretical concepts derived from literature on project management and learning in project-based firms to analyze the ongoing standardization efforts for fast-charged electric bus systems in europe. the analysis suggests that niche aggregation is a cyclical process that depends on two learning processes: knowledge sharing and knowledge accumulation. whereas knowledge sharing is an interactive process that involves several organizations, knowledge accumulation is an internal organizational learning process that enables firms to move beyond local niche projects and engage in external networks. these learning processes are mutually reinforcing and jointly support niche aggregation.\",\"effective public resource allocation to escape lock-in: the case of infrastructure-dependent vehicle technologies. a multi-stage technological substitution model of infrastructuredependent vehicle technologies is developed. this is used to examine how the allocation of public, financial resources to rd&d support and infrastructure development affects the replacement of a locked-in vehicle technology by more sustainable ones. although consumers eventually determine which vehicle technology will be successful, intervention and financial support by public agencies can affect the technological substitution process. computer simulations provide insights into the trade-off between investing in rd&d, i.e. the creation of new technological options (variety), and investing in infrastructure development for these technologies. the paper ends with policy recommendations.\",\"learning to shield - policy learning in socio-technical transitions. the dynamics of protection in the context of socio-technical niches have remained under-researched. in this paper we conceptualise the process of policy learning in the context of transitions. we show that a variety of actors inside and outside a technological niche have to learn about the implications and effects of regulations aimed at protection of niches. we analyse this process of policy learning in two cases: high-need drugs and electric vehicles. we conclude that both regulators and the regulated need to learn about the width and depth of protection measures, their duration, the specific set of tools used, and their legitimisation. a crucial issue of implementing protective regulation is the question on what level of aggregation protection measures need to be applied. learning is often part of the negotiation process between the protector and the protected, but in many cases learning only takes place after policies have been implemented.\",\"inter-niche competition on ice? socio-technical drivers, benefits and barriers of the electric vehicle transition in iceland. this paper investigates the drivers, benefits and barriers of battery electric vehicle (bev) development and an ongoing bev transition in iceland from a sociotechnical perspective. we focus on the following research questions: 1) what are the most promising driving forces behind bev growth? 2) why are bevs restricted mostly to the niche level? 3) what are the possible opportunities for bev future development? and 4) how viable are bevs as a solution to harnessing low-carbon renewable sources in iceland? the study uses original qualitative data comprising 29 research interviews involving experts from a wide range of sectors. the conceptual framework of multi-mode interaction, or \\u201cinter-niche competition\\u201d, is incorporated into the mlp to illustrate the interaction between bevs and other technologies, in particular, plugin hybrid electric vehicles. we find that bevs may take de-alignment and re-alignment pathway or reconfiguration pathway depending on the multi-technology interaction modes.\",\"integrating a business model perspective into transition theory: the example of new mobility services. business model innovation is increasingly seen as a means to promote sustainable forms of production and consumption, having been linked to technological innovations in electric vehicles and the circular economy. business models are an organisational phenomenon that concern focal firms and their networks. however, there is no theory of the firm in transition theory, such that the role of business model innovation in wider transformative processes is unclear. this paper aims to redress this issue by combining a business model perspective with core concepts and constructs from transition theory. we elucidate sources of change and inertia that issue from new and existing business models, illustrating our arguments by focusing on mobility services, which have the potential to radically transform road transportation via new business models. we derive new lines of inquiry that can be used to examine the dynamics of business model innovation in the context of sustainability transitions.\",\"fluid transitions to more sustainable product service systems. while product service systems (pss) are not inherently sustainable, they may form part of the mix of innovations that contribute to the development of more sustainable futures. however, whether the current trajectory of pss research, with its emphasis on universal frameworks and standardisation adequately reflects and builds upon pss diversity revealed by case study research may be questioned. opportunities for transition to more sustainable pss may be lost. in response, this paper draws on sustainable architecture to propose fluid transitions to more sustainable pss: to pss design practices that embrace diversity and enable specific pss to be developed which address contextual interpretations of sustainability challenges. the core ideas of the pss design are critically engaged in light of the principles and priorities of fluid transitions. research directions to support fluid transitions to more sustainable pss design practices are then explicated.\",\"pioneer countries in the transition to alternative transport fuels: comparison of ethanol programmes and policies in brazil, malawi and sweden. efforts to develop alternative transport fuels and vehicles are found in countries varying tremendously in their level of economic development. in this paper, we compare the alternative fuels transition, focusing on ethanol, in three countries: brazil, malawi and sweden. each can be described as a pioneer in developing the physical and institutional infrastructure and stimulating innovation towards alternative transport fuels. we assess the transition in these pioneer countries based on niche formation and interaction with regime and landscape levels. particular reference is made to spatial and temporal path dependencies and to the significance of cross-scale and cross-sector effects that impact the innovation process. as other countries and regions develop programmes to address the twin challenges of energy security and climate change, they can benefit from a better understanding of linkages between techno-economic and socio-technical factors in transition paths of pioneer countries, across different scales and different stages of economic development.\",\"align, adapt or amplify: upscaling strategies for car sharing business models in sydney, australia. since new business models may deviate from the current regime, they require protective spaces, called niches, for their development. the regime both enables and restricts opportunities for designing business models, thereby defining a \\u2018business model design space\\u2019 that can be dealt with in different ways for niche upscaling. we conducted a qualitative, comparative case study including two types of car sharing business models in sydney. we focused on niche entrepreneurs\\u2019 upscaling strategies in enacting the niche business model design space and observed that entrepreneurs can align with the existing opportunities opposed by the regime. if there is a mismatch, entrepreneurs mostly adapt the internal organization part of their business model to re-align, or use their networks to \\u2018amplify\\u2019 the current business model design space. this leads to new business model designs and affects either company or niche. sydney may serve as an example for other car dependent cities.\",\"telework and the transition to lower energy use in transport: on the relevance of rebound effects. policies to reduce congestion and energy use in transport have been rather ineffective in most countries during the last decades, partly due to rebound effects. telework has been proposed as a promising way to reduce energy use in transport. experiences with telework indicate that this is not as widespread as is often thought and that various rebound effects exist. a transition towards a large scale introduction of telework would involve the overcoming of various barriers by changes in the internal organization of firms, changes in the social responsibility of firms, and changes in life styles and activity patterns of workers.\",\"towards a sufficiency-driven business model: experiences and opportunities. business model innovation is an important lever for change to tackle pressing sustainability issues. in this paper, 'sufficiency' is proposed as a driver of business model innovation for sustainability. sufficiency-driven business models seek to moderate overall resource consumption by curbing demand through education and consumer engagement, making products that last longer and avoiding built-in obsolescence, focusing on satisfying 'needs' rather than promoting 'wants' and fast-fashion, conscious sales and marketing techniques, new revenue models, or innovative technology solutions. this paper uses a case study approach to investigate how companies might use sufficiency as a driver for innovation and asserts that there can be a good business case for sufficiency. business models of exemplar cases are analysed and insights are gained that will contribute to future research, policy makers and businesses interested in exploring sufficiency.\",\"lessons from a century of innovating car recycling value chains. end-of-life vehicles (elvs) contain materials that may be beneficial to recycle. while metals such as iron, aluminium and platinum are recycled at high rates, materials such plastics and most scarce metals are recycled at low rates or not at all. insight into how recycling systems form and develop is limited in current research, but may provide a better understanding for how to increase recycling rates. this paper utilises the technological innovation system framework to identify key functions from 1910 to 2010 that enabled elv iron recycling in sweden. initiatives for improving capabilities to recycle other materials are also discussed. results indicate that early structural changes in the steel industry were crucial. subsequently, elv iron could be utilised by this industry through build-up of an increasingly specialised elv system. we argue that reproducing the key functions that enabled elv iron recycling may serve to increase recycling rates also of other elv materials.\",\"conspicuous diffusion: theorizing how status drives innovation in electric mobility. this paper explores how conceptions of luxury and status affect the manner in which a relatively novel technology\\u2014an electric vehicle\\u2014 diffuses across societies. to do so, it combines veblen's notion of conspicuous consumption and roger's diffusion of innovation by proposing a new theoretical variation, which we term \\u201cconspicuous diffusion.\\u201d the paper sketches natural connections between the two theories, namely how conspicuous consumption relates to technological and societal development, and how diffusion of innovation is intrinsically connected to status. in combining these approaches, we hypothesize that the success of an innovation is guided by its adherence to the canons of conspicuousness and conspicuous value, which it loses as the innovation diffuses across the population. to illustrate the explanatory power of conspicuous diffusion, we examine the status of electric vehicles in the nordic region, based on original data from multiple methods, including expert interviews and focus groups. we find that conspicuous diffusion can explain previous failures and current successes of electric vehicle diffusion patterns. the paper concludes with recommendations for policymakers, industry, and academia.\",\"the ev paradox - a multilevel study of why stockholm is not a leader in electric vehicles. despite seemingly favourable conditions for alternative road-based transport technologies, progress on battery electric vehicles (bevs) have been slow in stockholm. we investigate why, applying the multilevel perspective for socio-technical transitions to a local case study of stockholm. using in-depth interviews with key actors we trace processes and discuss possible explanations at niche, regime and landscape levels. the results show that niche developments are clearly lacking, resulting in limited experience and knowledge of bevs, and enduring conceptions among both policymakers and consumers. regime actors are also ambivalent towards bevs, leading to limited regime action with for example car companies moving more to plugin hybrid electric vehicles instead of bevs. finally, there is uncertainty as a result of a lack of strong policy signals for bevs, in turn driven by policy makers' aversion against technology-specific support. we outline what governance gaps need to be addressed to induce faster progress on bev uptake.\",\"examining the vehicle-to-grid niche in australia through the lens of a trial project. vehicle-to-grid is a promising source of the shallow storage needed for australia's energy transition. however, it is a niche innovation dependent on other new technologies. the paper describes the australian vehicle-to-grid niche via examination of a trial and sets an agenda for niche development. the multi-level perspective provides understanding of the processes of socio-technical transitions and strategic niche management provides a tool for facilitating development and linking with policy. the study found that the australian vehicle-to-grid niche is at an embryonic stage and is yet to stabilise into a dominant form. variety and non-technical learning are lacking and expectations underestimate the significance of existing infrastructures and user factors as well as the scope of complementary technologies. greater experimentation with users and installation premises are recommended, plus engaging more actors and intermediaries. the study concludes with directions for further research in multi-system interactions and transitions in importer countries like australia.\",\"understanding the drivers of fleet emission reduction activities of the german car manufacturers. the current mobility system, dominated by fossil fuel powered automobiles, is under increasing pressure due to its environmental impact. to address this issue there is a need for a transition of the system towards one that is more sustainable, including the introduction of car technologies that allow a decrease in fuel consumption and the substitution of fossil fuels as primary energy source. due to the stability of the current automotive industry and the dominance of the internal combustion engine technology, it is expected that the incumbent firms and their activities will play a crucial role in the transition. policy makers have therefore introduced a variety of policies to encourage the industry to provide suitable solutions. we have conducted a micro-level analysis of how the three main german car manufacturers have changed their activities in the field of low emission vehicle technologies in response to national/international events and policy making. our analysis suggests that policy makers only have limited influence on the type of disruptive solution that is chosen by these individual companies and that activities related to solutions that were not familiar to the individual car manufacturer were mainly induced by internal or external champions. still, while the existence of regulatory policies allowed such activities to succeed, on its own it only encouraged the industry to work on incremental solutions based upon the knowledge already possessed.\",\"the role of lock-in mechanisms in transition processes: the case of energy for road transport. this paper revisits the theoretical concepts of lock-in mechanisms to analyse transition processes in energy production and road transportation in the nordic countries, focussing on three technology platforms: advanced biofuels, e-mobility and hydrogen and fuel cell electrical vehicles. the paper is based on a comparative analysis of case studies. the main lock-in mechanisms analysed are learning effects, economies of scale, economies of scope, network externalities, informational increasing returns, technological interrelatedness, collective action, institutional learning effects and the differentiation of power. we show that very different path dependencies have been reinforced by the lock-in mechanisms. hence, the characteristics of existing regimes set the preconditions for the development of new transition pathways. the incumbent socio-technical regime is not just fossil-based, but may also include mature niches specialised in the exploitation of renewable sources. this implies a need to distinguish between lock-in mechanisms favouring the old fossil-based regime, well-established (mature) renewable energy niches, or new pathways.\",\"public policy strategies for next-generation vehicle technologies: an overview of leading markets. governments apply a range of policy instruments to promote the electrification of personal transport using technologies such as plug-in hybrid, battery electric, and fuel cell electric vehicles. we introduce a framework for comparing public policies cross-nationally used to support the research, development, and deployment of electric vehicles. we use this framework to identify whether governments are using similar policy instruments to promote vehicle electrification in the period 2006-2016. we also examine the extent to which policy instruments are neutral across technologies, presenting country case studies for china, the united states, japan, and, within the regulatory framework of the european union, germany, and france. we find that governments have largely adopted technology neutral policies and are employing similar policy mixes in promoting vehicle electrification, despite differences in governing institutions between the countries examined. we conclude by suggesting a future research agenda, including identifying plausible explanations for this outcome.\",\"on the relation between communication and innovation activities: a comparison of hybrid electric and fuel cell vehicles. the automotive industry has proposed and announced a number of technological innovations to reduce the environmental impact of transport. whereas initially many of the proposed technologies were surrounded by very optimistic expectations, many technological innovations are not commercially available yet and expectations eventually turned into disappointment. the hypes concerning these alternative drivetrain technologies collapsed when optimistic announcements could not be met, within the proposed timeframe. this paper analyzes the relation between research and development activities (innovation activities) and communication activities in the automotive industry using patent statistics, press releases and interviews. the analysis reveals that the underlying characteristics of the specific technology have an influence on the relation between communication and innovation activities. when innovations depend on the build-up of a new infrastructure actors have a strong incentive to raise expectations. this suggests that the specific shape of the hype cycle is depending on the complexity of the technology.\",\"transition inertia due to competition in supply chains with remanufacturing and recycling: a systems dynamics model. this paper studies the link between capital goods supply chains and sociotechnical transitions. research on the latter has so far tended to focus on sustainability, energy and transport systems. despite the considerable shift from products to services, supply chains are an integral element of most sociotechnical systems and there seems to be no foreseeable substitute for them. consequently, for transitions to sustainability to take place, the inertia of supply chains in these systems has to be overcome and their environmental impact reduced. the paper explores this with a system dynamics model of a supply chain. while remanufacturing of used products by the retailer and recycling by the supplier can reduce the environmental impact of the supply chain, competition in the market between new and remanufactured products forces them into a situation where improving business and environmental performance is difficult.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"2_niche_innovation_technology\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"2_niche_innovation_technology\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[7.34118127822876,6.749257564544678,8.631843566894531,7.323238849639893,7.7660136222839355,7.804455757141113,7.0780768394470215,6.671927452087402,6.8674468994140625,6.755544662475586,7.039322853088379,7.560524940490723,8.345293998718262,7.681848049163818,7.209592342376709,7.369157791137695,8.16215991973877,6.944423675537109,7.288830280303955,7.4603047370910645,7.530339241027832,9.520357131958008,7.4646830558776855,6.864267349243164,7.482779026031494,8.51001262664795,7.3917036056518555,7.8125834465026855,6.997427463531494,7.5399651527404785,7.633007049560547,6.9101786613464355,7.550323963165283,7.1764678955078125,7.0057878494262695,7.455102920532227,6.662060260772705,6.860223770141602,7.7505974769592285,6.728756904602051,7.169039249420166,8.056217193603516,8.135577201843262,6.716152191162109,7.331900596618652,7.064083576202393,7.536823749542236,8.41663646697998,7.33488130569458,7.580626964569092,7.319400310516357,8.492091178894043,6.694945335388184,7.400402069091797,7.218306541442871,7.063418865203857,6.747169494628906,7.000334739685059,6.8659796714782715,6.861970901489258,8.464812278747559,7.415866374969482],\"y\":[6.465019702911377,6.208487033843994,7.406440734863281,6.682758808135986,6.39360237121582,6.980247974395752,6.383963108062744,6.386768817901611,6.4538397789001465,6.431922435760498,6.322306156158447,6.897070407867432,7.3610944747924805,6.871698379516602,6.320533275604248,6.219626426696777,7.2149529457092285,6.333837509155273,6.305676460266113,6.613515377044678,6.411226272583008,7.373155117034912,6.639919757843018,6.167057514190674,6.481085777282715,7.353661060333252,6.460848331451416,6.4950714111328125,6.256866455078125,6.779145240783691,6.3927903175354,6.148230075836182,6.40369987487793,6.25002908706665,6.379411697387695,6.485916614532471,6.30293083190918,6.147270679473877,6.414241790771484,6.280355930328369,6.294134616851807,7.183947563171387,7.439029216766357,6.3313069343566895,6.331524848937988,6.172172546386719,6.842955589294434,7.367457866668701,6.188535690307617,6.699947834014893,6.628087997436523,7.354549407958984,6.26453161239624,6.568228721618652,6.2591938972473145,6.16948938369751,6.2275800704956055,6.348411560058594,6.159381866455078,6.40769624710083,7.371169090270996,6.565337657928467],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"agricultural

confront and, or enhance the regime's aks. the paper draws on empirical data from a study of the permaculture community in england. the analysis describes the boundary between the knowledge systems of the permaculture niche and the mainstream agricultural regime. rather than a simple notion of pks confronting or enhancing the aks there are multiple knowledge processes operating which both maintain

system summit. the high ambition of the un food systems summit (fss) 2021 was to create system change towards sustainable food systems in a participatory and just way. the new holistic perspective of food systems opened a new arena in which narratives competed for attention. this made the fss an opportunity to develop and discuss alternative transition pathways, brought forward by less powerful voices. however, profound and sustained critique accompanied the summit and draws a rather dejected picture of its achievements. by analysing how the procedural justice of the fss is assessed by actor groups proposing different narratives of sustainable food systems, we examine the opportunities and limits of a global governing body like the un/fao to foster system change in a procedurally just way.\",\"incentivizing a regime change in dutch agriculture. regime changes are hard to incentivize as behaviour is difficult to change. as efforts towards environmentally sustainable agricultural practices indicate, farmers are reluctant to adopt new practices. this study analyses whether policy packages of mixed public and private payments could be effective in incentivizing a regime change, and how targeting payments could further enhance this effect. we implemented a choice experiment among a large sample of dutch crop (n = 296) and dairy (n = 514) farmers. our results highlight the importance of offering policy packages of mixed incentives to stimulate farmers to adopt nature-inclusive farming practices. the combination of incentives is more effective than individual incentives alone, and targeting policies to sectors and farmers greatly enhances effectiveness: mainstream farmers require higher incentives to change their practices than farmers that already made changes on their land. this also highlights the importance of including non-financial elements in policy design for targeting especially mainstream farmers.\",\"rage against the regime: niche-regime interactions in the societal embedding of plant-based milk. this paper engages with the debate on niche-regime interactions in sustainability transitions, using a study of plant-based milk and its struggles against the entrenched liquid dairy-milk regime, which has various sustainability problems. plant-based milk is under-studied, so our empirical contribution consists of an exploration of its diffusion in the uk. we make three conceptual contributions. the first calls for a bidirectional analysis that addresses niche-oriented activities by incumbent actors, in addition to the outward-oriented activities by niche advocates presented in most studies of niche-regime interaction. the second contribution nuances smith and raven's fit-and-conform and stretch-and-transform typology: using a societal embedding framework which distinguishes four environments, we suggest that hybrid patterns are possible in which innovations follow a \\u2018fit\\u2019 pattern in one environment but \\u2018stretch\\u2019 in another. the third contribution highlights the potential role of cultural meanings in galvanizing transitions by eroding positive associations that support the regime and stabilise consumer purchasing.\",\"institutional work as a key ingredient of food innovation success: the case of plant-based proteins. in this paper, we use the theory of institutional work to understand how plant-based meat substitutes emerge and successfully diffuse in the context of a dominant meat regime in the united states (us). we observe that institutional factors such as norms, habits, values, and beliefs play a more vital role than previously identified. therefore, we utilize institutional work theory combined with insights from technological innovation systems to create a holistic understanding of this transition. we study the american plant-based protein industry from 1978 to 2019. we conduct a qualitative event-history analysis based on 2345 events from the nexis uni database. we observe that by strategically deploying institutional work strategies aimed at creating, maintaining, and disrupting institutions and innovation system-building strategies, innovation system actors created a favorable environment in which meat alternatives can flourish.\",\"just transition principles and criteria for food systems and beyond. in this article, we propose a framework of principles and criteria for just transitions in food systems. climate mitigation activities are urgently needed in food systems, but can have damaging social, environmental, economic, and health impacts. consequently, food system transitions can cause significant side effects across and beyond food systems, aggravating existing inequalities and unsustainabilities, causing new ones, or hampering equal engagement in the transition itself. thus, justice questions stand at the core of assessing decarbonization pathways and policies and must link to other sectors as well: who bears the costs and who enjoys the benefits of the transitions? can transitions be inclusive, leaving no one behind? we examine the establishment and purpose of general principles and food system-specific criteria for just transition, present the framework \\u2013 standards for judging, evaluating, and deliberating justice in food system transitions \\u2013 and reflect upon the uses of the framework and future developments.\",\"just transitions through agroecological innovations in family farming in guatemala: enablers and barriers towards gender equality. addressing gender gaps is crucial for just transitions in family farming. this study explores enablers and barriers within agroecological innovations to promote gender equality and just transitions in family farming in guatemala. emphasis is put on female farmers\\u2019 perceptions as key agents for just transitions. the results showed that agroecological innovations strengthen female farmers\\u2019 roles in family farming and contribute to distributive justice, albeit not sufficiently. the leadership school in the network's farmer organization increases the capabilities of female farmers, enabling participation in decision-making, networking and enhancing their sense of community belonging. yet low female participation in decision-making in farmer organizations is perceived as a barrier to change in a male-dominated organizational culture. funding gaps in public institutions and farmer organizations are also perceived as barriers to closing gender gaps in family farming. for just transitions in family farming, more research on gender-responsive budgets and intersectional gender approaches is suggested.\",\"sharing is caring: the role of culture in the transformative capacity and continuation of agri-food networks. during the last several decades, inter-organizational collaboration in the food sector has emerged to tackle complex problems such as sustainability. however, in practice, these networks often either fall short of their goal or disband. therefore, we investigate the role of culture within these networks to gain insights into the transformative capacity and (dis)continuation of such agri-food networks. although agri-food networks are a common research topic in transition studies, our understanding of the role that culture plays in them can be improved. to better understand culture in agri-food networks, we compare eight cases. results indicate that a shared culture affect the development and continuation of these innovative networks. despite the intention of many agri-food networks to transform the agri-food system, they tend to reproduce it and effect incremental rather than radical changes. the degree of such changes was found to be related to the cultural (dis)similarities between the agri-food network and the agri-food system.\",\"ontological struggle over new product category: transition potential of meat alternatives. in recent sustainability transitions research, more attention has been called to dynamic relations between regimes and niches in complex processes of systemic change. in this paper, we provide the case of meat alternative markets, which have been expanding rapidly in europe and in northern america. during this expansion, animal-free alternatives are in a contradictory situation. in aiming to carve out market space for these products the aim is to be as similar to meat as possible. in this paper we study how, in finland, the niche actors have situated themselves within the regime by detaching from the first generation of plant-based foods and attaching to shared rules, materialities and cultural meanings in the meat regime. we discuss how the concepts of detachment and attachment can help in understanding further the transitional pathways created as niches aim to fit-and-transform the rules of the market, and the regime.\",\"evolutionary models of sustainable economic change in brazil: no-till agriculture, reduced deforestation and ethanol biofuels. this paper examines the historical drivers and barriers of three mitigation actions in brazil: the expansion of no-till agriculture, reduction of deforestation, and increased displacement of gasoline with ethanol. the characteristics of these three economic changes align with evolutionary economic theories rather than neoclassical or environmental economics. despite its cost-effectiveness, diffusion of no-till agriculture was contingent on social learning and flows of information within the agricultural regime. brazil's success in reducing deforestation rates was driven not by policies that changed the microeconomic calculation of farmers, but by command-and-control policies on deforestation enabled through landscape shifts. brazil's ethanol biofuels industry emerged due to both niche level innovation of ethanol production systems and pure-ethanol vehicles, and shifts at the landscape level that enabled mandated fuel blends, public procurement programmes, and public investment in r&d. these three economic changes correspond with the categories of reproduction, transformation and transition, respectively.\",\"beyond food for thought \\u2013 directing sustainability transitions research to address fundamental change in agri-food systems. dominant agricultural and food systems lead to continuous resource depletion and unacceptable environmental and social impacts. while current calls for changing agrifood systems are increasingly framed in the context of sustainability transitions, they rarely make an explicit link to transition studies to address these systemic challenges, nor do transition scholars sufficiently address agri-food systems, despite their global pertinence. from this viewpoint, we illustrate several gaps in the agri-food systems debate that sustainability transition studies could engage in. we propose four avenues for research in the next decade of transition research on agri-food systems: 1) crossscale dynamics between coupled systems; 2) social justice, equity and inclusion; 3) sustainability transitions in low- and middle-income countries; 4) cross-sectoral governance and system integration. we call for a decade of new transition research that moves beyond single-scale and sector perspectives toward more inclusive and integrated analyses of food system dynamics.\",\"introduction to the special issue on just food system transition: tackling inequalities for sustainability. this special issue builds understanding of just transitions by looking at specific dynamics in food system transitions. the articles in the special issue apply a multi-dimensional understanding of justice, which stress that in addition to distributional matters, also recognition and procedural justice require attention in transitions. the current injustices in the food system emphasize the interrelatedness of these dimensions. the special issue includes eight articles that scrutinize food system transition in various contexts from finland to brazil and from farm-level decision-making to the un food system summit. the papers demonstrate the focality of recognition justice for interpreting contestations around sustainability transitions. they also draw attention to existing power imbalances that affect the alternative visions of sustainability and need attention for procedural justice. in future, salient power analysis and normative frameworks are required to spot trade-offs and blind spots in just transition.\",\"contribution of transition theory to the study of geographical indications. the green revolution and globalization have profoundly transformed agri-food systems, leading to standardized food products of diminished taste quality. geographical indications (gis) have emerged as powerful regulatory tools for sustaining alternative quality models. in this paper, we analyze gis as governance tools for \\u201cterroir niches\\u201d viewed as sociotechnical systems whose functioning is influenced by specific resources. building on this framework, we study the reconfiguration of the corsican clementine production area under a recent geographical indication. we show that the innovation trajectory was driven by specific resources (climate, with-leaf marketing), leading to the emergence of a niche that conflicted with the rules of the citrus regime. the implementation of a gi in the early 2000s strengthened this endogenous innovation pathway since it gave the niche renewed protection and prompted systemic changes. these results open prospects for cross-fertilization between gi studies and the multi-level perspective on sustainability transitions.\",\"the creation of legitimacy in grassroots organisations: a study of dutch community-supported agriculture. grassroots initiatives for sustainable development are blossoming, offering localised alternatives for a range of societal functions including food and energy. research into grassroots organisations often recognises the difficulties grassroots groups face to continue operations. however, there is a need for better understanding dynamics that enable or constrain grassroots organisational survival. here, we specifically shed light on how such survival is dependent on the organisation's ability to construct legitimacy. in the context of community supported agriculture (csa), we explore different legitimacy types and strategies. we learned that csas predominantly work to garner legitimacy from their members and that survival seems associated with social capital building. in addition, we observed a moralisation of food provision that describes why new and possibly inconvenient terms of exchange still amass legitimacy. as external audiences remain at a distance, they often misunderstand csa, their deliverables and impacts on social welfare.\",\"can living labs offer a pathway to support local agri-food sustainability transitions?. living labs are defined as both an approach and an arena for supporting experimentation in natural settings with a wide range of actors. in this article we explore the potential and limits of living labs for analysing and supporting the local transition of agri-food systems. we base on a bibliometric analysis and insights from our transdisciplinary research team's experience with agroecological transition. it appears that living labs informed mainly by strategic managerial and user-centric approaches benefiting the dissemination of (technological) innovation, require certain changes in order to address sustainable development issues. citizen-centred living lab approaches are better suited to increase capacity building and empowerment through action, iterative learning, and capitalization of experience. faced with the specific issues of local agri-food system transition, we propose to (re)-introduce the notion of \\u201ccommons\\u201d in order to support the collective territorial management of both material resources (food, environment) and immaterial resources (values, ideas).\",\"understanding the protein transition: the rise of plant-based meat substitutes. even though the food system is responsible for a significant part of global greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions and a transition to a sustainable food system is needed, the growing body of literature on sustainability transitions has paid little attention to the food processing sector. we expect transition dynamics in the food processing sector to differ from the typical dynamics portrayed in transitions literature due to particularities in required technological knowledge and government intervention. to better understand dynamics in the food processing sector we apply the technological innovations systems (tis) framework to an in-depth case study of the plant-based meat substitutes industry in the netherlands. results illustrate that, contrary to many other transitions, consumers and changing informal institutions are the driving forces of this process. we show how strengthening cognitive and normative legitimacy can lead to growing markets for sustainable products.\",\"analysing the role of consumers within technological innovation systems: the case of alternative food networks. in recent years, an increasing number of studies have stressed the relevance of the consumer experience in the research about new trajectories towards sustainability. these studies suggest that consumers should not be viewed solely as passive agents who select between different commercial options. this paper argues for a broader application of technological innovation system (tis) conceptual framework and proposes an analytical approach that explicitly considers consumers and producers as interacting and then co-evolving actors. we apply the tis framework to the food industry, a low-medium technology sector where several \\u201calternative\\u201d food networks (afn) are emerging and acting as innovative systems in the transition towards sustainability. the analysis allows us to better understand the common structure and the functional patterns shared by the various models of afns. the paper points out how the interactive relation between consumers and producers may foster the transition into a more sustainable socio-technical regime.\",\"farming on the margins: just transition and the resilience of peripheral farms. sustainability transition demands fundamental changes taking place at the farm system level. at the same time, many farms are operating on the verge of financial profitability, especially in geographically disadvantaged peripheral regions with a limited range of production opportunities. these observations raise concerns about the transition's justice aspects. using the concept of resilience, we analysed farmers\\u2019 capacities for transformation in a peripheral context in finland. the results from our farmer survey (n = 577) indicated that the regime exerts a strong cost-price squeeze on farmers, escaping of which is difficult also for farmers deliberately seeking new pathways beyond it. due to farmers\\u2019 dependence on the regime, drastic changes to \\u2018the rules of the game\\u2019 could undermine their resilience. we argue that for transition processes to be both sustainable and just, proactive restorative justice should aim at promoting resilience at the farm level by deliberately building inclusive and accessible transition pathways.\",\"a social innovation perspective on dietary transitions: diffusion of vegetarianism and veganism in austria. studies and media attention suggest that the number of vegetarians and vegans in austria and other western european countries is increasing. because certain convictions act as triggers that change dietary patterns, vegetarianism and veganism seem to be connected with the concept of social innovation. using a mixed-mode sampling strategy, a sample that included 508 vegans, vegetarians, omnivores and conscientious omnivores from austria was evaluated. the trend toward vegetarianism and veganism was analysed using social innovations as the theoretical lens. the contributions and convictions expressed by the responding vegetarians and vegans indicated that their nutritional choices can influence their responses to social challenges raised by specific issues, such as climate change and animal welfare. we conclude that further research is needed to identify factors that promote the diffusion of vegetarian and vegan practices as a social innovation.\",\"agri-food transitions and the \\u201cgreen public sphere\\u201d in china. studies of china's agri-food transitions have so far largely overlooked the role of the public in policymaking and practice. we argue that a deeper understanding of public perceptions of \\u2013 and engagement with \\u2013 agricultural innovation, is required to better understanding the dynamic responses that exist to the multiple complex and intersecting challenges facing china's food and agriculture system. in order to demonstrate the kinds of additional evidence that might contribute to an enhanced understanding of the role of the public sphere in china's agri-food transitions, we present findings from an exploratory project drawing on qualitative field research. focussing in particular on public perceptions of genetically-modified crops, we suggest a number of preliminary insights that confirm, challenge or supplement earlier findings. we use this study, in the particular socio-political context of china, to shed light on the complex role of public perceptions (elsewhere in the transitions literature referred to as \\u2018market/ user preferences\\u2019 or \\u2018culture\\u2019) in agri-food transitions. this raises important questions for the governance of chinese agri-food transitions and how future research might better inform its response to a changing public sphere.\",\"sustainability, justice and equity in food systems: ideas and proposals in dispute in brazil. the impacts of food systems on climate change are of growing concern as meat consumption and the soy-meat complex expand. this article explores contrasting ideas, proposals and narratives in the brazilian context with its significant power asymmetries and identifies two broad discursive repertoires voiced by the private sector, civil society and government to differently address issues of food and environmental justice, social equity and climate change. the influence of these repertoires on public policies can induce or hinder just transitions in food systems. documents from 2008 to 2021 are analyzed, mainly focusing on multi-scale food systems, dimensions of justice and corporate political action. contrasting perspectives on the drivers of inequalities and sustainability are also presented, along with respective proposals ranging from paradigm shifts in food systems to topical solutions based on private mechanisms.\",\"forever niche: why do organically bred vegetable varieties not diffuse?. while organic food increased its market share in conventional food retail, virtually all organic vegetables are still conventionally bred. for decades, organically bred vegetable varieties remained a market niche, despite their socio-ecological benefits. this paper conceptualizes actors and activities around organic breeding as a technological innovation system (tis) and analyzes what prevents these varieties from widely diffusing into conventional supermarkets. investigated systemic barriers relate to knowledge, market formation, investments, and legitimacy. the study is based on interviews with food retailers and (commons-based) breeding initiatives across germany. theoretically, the paper adds an innovation system perspective on the diffusion of organically bred varieties, a blind spot in the emerging seed commons debate. furthermore, it contributes to sustainability transitions literature by introducing a novel empirical topic and reframing the tis framework to analyze agri-food innovations. identifying barriers and vicious cycles might support practitioners and policymakers seeking to diffuse this agri-food niche.\",\"the transition of agriculture to low carbon pathways with regional distributive impacts. this study, based on agricultural sector modelling, shows how changes in food consumption and land use measures can reduce ghg emissions from finnish agriculture, and what are the impacts on regional levels of agricultural production, land use, ghg emissions, and farm income. the results demonstrate that it is difficult to achieve a large reduction in ghg emissions from agriculture by just changing diet alone. there is a big disparity in the distribution of farm income among the main regions in finland due to a radical decrease in the consumption of livestock products. however, land use measures alone do not create the disparity in farm income among the different regions. combining changes in diet and land use is the most effective in mitigating ghg emissions from agriculture, but the relatively disadvantaged regions with high shares of livestock production and peatlands may experience major restructuring in agriculture and land use.\",\"endogenous regime change: lessons from transition pathways in dutch dairy farming. sustainability transitions are commonly considered impossible without regime change. theoretical work on regime change has mainly focused on niches and landscapes and less on change \\u2018from within\\u2019. empirical analysis helps theorising endogenous regime change. conceptualising regimes as semi-coherent entities composed of multiple \\u2018institutional logics\\u2019, we analyse the endogenous regime change in dutch dairy farming. practices in this sector have become more and more market-driven. this dominant logic however was increasingly challenged by institutional logics centring round cultural identity and sustainability. tensions particularly centred round the increased indoor housing of cows. the contestation of this practice eventually led to a first \\u2018crack\\u2019 in the regime, as it weakened the dominance of the market logic and enabled opportunities for more sustainability. our case study shows that the presence of alternative institutional logics is necessary to crack the regime, but opportunities to patch it back together are similarly crucial to enable sustainability transitions.\",\"deepening democracy for the governance toward just transitions in agri-food systems. in this paper, we explore the relation between democracy and justice in governing agri-food transitions. we argue that a deeper understanding of democracy is needed to foster just transitions. first, we present a multi-dimensional understanding of justice in transitions and relate it to scholarship on democratizing transitions. then, we argue that three paradigm shifts are required to overcome current unsustainable dynamics: (1) from expert toward pluralist understandings of knowledge; (2) from economic materialism toward post-growth strategies; and (3) from anthropocentrism toward reconnecting human-nature relationships. we explicate what these paradigm shifts entail for democratizing transitions from distributive, procedural, recognition and restorative justice perspectives. finally, we highlight six challenges to institutionalizing deep democratic governance. these entail balancing tensions between: multiple justice dimensions, democracy and urgency, top-down and bottom-up directionalities, local and global scales, realism and idealism, and roles of incumbent scientific systems. this requires thoroughly rethinking transition studies\\u2019 normative and democratic ambitions.\",\"a psychometric approach to assess justice perceptions in support of the governance of agricultural sustainability transitions. there is consensus that we need sustainability transitions and increasing acknowledgement that such transitions should be conducted in a just manner. however, what exactly a \\u2018just transition\\u2019 means and how this should be brought about is less clear. attempts to examine the justice of transitions to date primarily rely on normative interpretations of what justice means. using the english agricultural transition as a case, we develop an instrument that builds on the underlying dimensions of justice evaluations to provide a tool for decision-makers to gain insights into societal perceptions of what a just agricultural transition means to them. when adapted, this instrument is also valuable for sustainability transitions in other sectors. we establish adequate construct reliability and validity for a number of constructs such as equality, entitlement, and merit as principles of procedural justice, whilst others such as the different topics of distributional justice will need further refinement.\",\"veganism and plant-based protein crops: contentious visioning almost obstructing a transition. trust is crucial in efforts for sustainability transitions. it is a prerequisite for actors to engage in new practices. but how can trust be generated under the conditions of uncertainty that come with letting go of familiar routines? this article answers this question empirically, analyzing how trust was actively constructed alongside a common vision, in a project promoting legume production in sweden, part of the \\u2018protein transition\\u2019. while a growing vegan market presented an opportunity to valorize legumes, the project's participating farmers distrusted the envisioned changes and viewed veganism as a threat. applying a heuristic framework that enables analysis of the intertwinement of learning and trusting, the analysis shows that system level vulnerabilities and uncertainties interfered with inter-personal dynamics of trust. the analysis provided a basis for designing strategic interventions. the article concludes that visioning had to interact with experienced vulnerabilities and uncertainties of participating actors, to gradually build trust. it therefore shows how trust is an essential dimension to consider when searching for congruence in interactive visioning.\",\"sustainability transitions in the agri-food sector: how ecology affects transition dynamics. in this paper, we study sustainability transitions in agriculture and highlight several elements that distinguish transition dynamics in this sector from those more frequently studied in the socio-technical transitions literature. our assumption is that ecological dimensions of agricultural systems affect transition dynamics. we illustrate this by focusing on two central characteristics related to biodiversity conservation: place-based embeddedness and the public goods\\u2019 character of biodiversity. a qualitative, multiple-case study was conducted on the dutch dairy sector by carrying out 22 in-depth interviews. we show how change in the agricultural sector is strongly geographically embedded and dependent on regime actors who need to be enabled and incentivized to partake in the transition process. due to the public goods\\u2019 character of biodiversity, there is a strong focus on the development of institutional novelty. dynamics of change show a specific fit between ecological conditions and innovation.\",\"justice in transitions: widening considerations of justice in dietary transition. just transition is gaining increasing attention. the need to consider social justice in sustainability transitions is finally being acknowledged. research on this issue has, to date, mainly concentrated on energy systems. in this paper, we examine how the elaboration of dietary transition widens the spectrum of justice questions in sustainability transitions research. we explicate the arising normative questions along the dimensions of distributive, procedural and recognitive justice; widening the considerations further to restorative and cosmopolitan justice. dietary transition widens the justice considerations to basic needs, food security and nutrition. by doing so, it evokes socio-cultural tensions that require recognition and procedural solutions. the uneven distribution of capacities to innovate and adapt require scrutiny from the just transition scholarship. likewise, the recognition of non-human animals and integrity of agro-ecological systems. the relational three-dimensional understanding of justice can advance inter- and transdisciplinary research across various systems.\",\"sustainable futures of agro-food? i\\u0307zmir's sustainable agro-food transitions in the making. the city of i\\u0307zmir-turkey has recently attracted interest for a range of actions regarding agro-food and been perceived as a pioneer in providing alternatives to the practices of the incumbent agro-food regime. this paper builds on the multi-level perspective as a heuristic device to place these actions within discussions of sustainable agro-food transitions. findings suggest that what could be considered as individual and isolated practices that diverge from agro-food regime may be viewed as sustainable niche alternatives from a transition perspective and hailed for sowing the seeds of an urban sustainability transition in the making. it is also demonstrated that making urban sustainability transitions in stabilized regimes such as agro-food, is as predicated on contestation and struggle as it is on policy devolution to localities, suggesting that sustainable agro-food transitions cannot be studied in isolation from the domain of urban policy and without incorporating adversarial struggle into the analysis. this paper comprises five sections. the introduction is followed by a conceptual section, outlining some of the key insights provided by the mlp and its application in an analysis of sustainability transitions. following a description of the methodology employed, the focus turns to i\\u0307zmir in the fourth section, offering empirical evidence that sustainable agro-food transitions are in the making in the city, which it does by addressing the generic pressures surrounding the agro-food regime and outlining the emerging local government-driven and bottom-up responses to these pressures that diverge from and run parallel to the prevailing agro-food regime. finally, the paper reflects on the implications of the findings for the role of cities in terms of their contribution to the struggle for a sustainable future for agro-food.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"3_food_justice_farmers\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"3_food_justice_farmers\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[11.448802947998047,11.75804615020752,11.49905776977539,11.949522018432617,11.989230155944824,11.83641242980957,11.550775527954102,11.574440956115723,11.974883079528809,12.369209289550781,11.5454740524292,11.777153015136719,11.63785171508789,11.473297119140625,11.51197338104248,11.933624267578125,11.956257820129395,11.435667037963867,11.825821876525879,11.577911376953125,11.79769229888916,11.689519882202148,12.53913402557373,11.446632385253906,11.594005584716797,11.756351470947266,11.611228942871094,11.44327163696289,11.796250343322754,11.085478782653809,11.7128324508667],\"y\":[11.34509563446045,10.99070930480957,11.382673263549805,11.446468353271484,11.425264358520508,11.009773254394531,11.496712684631348,11.437261581420898,11.467689514160156,8.551634788513184,11.408540725708008,11.002177238464355,11.456663131713867,11.438430786132812,11.42691421508789,11.470036506652832,11.508292198181152,11.36670970916748,11.14133358001709,11.444562911987305,11.024049758911133,11.499456405639648,8.691887855529785,11.326638221740723,11.0927095413208,10.972308158874512,11.464905738830566,11.320727348327637,11.03305435180664,10.839695930480957,11.116079330444336],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"an agent-based model of climate-energy policies to promote wind propulsion technology in shipping. the global trade share of international shipping is approximately 80% and it is therefore critical to

solutions to reduce shipping co2 emissions. these technologies face innovation barriers that potentially limit their diffusion. an agent-based model is developed to explore the effect of imperfect agent information and split incentives barriers that current shipping models omit. a transitions perspective is adopted to analyze the diffusion of flettner rotor technology in time charter drybulk

simultaneous introduction of carbon pricing and demonstration projects greatly increases co2 emission reductions to 2050 relative to either policy introduced in isolation.\",\"unrelated diversification in latecomer contexts: emergence of the chinese solar photovoltaics industry. new industries emerge in increasingly complex spatial patterns that challenge existing explanations of industrial path creation. in particular, the case of latecomer regions building up industries in fields that are unrelated to their previous industrial capabilities is not well understood in the literature. this paper aims to address this gap by expanding on an analytical framework that draws on innovation studies and catching-up literature to characterize unrelated diversification processes in latecomer contexts. a case study in the chinese solar photovoltaics (pv) sector reveals an industry formation process that differs from traditional models of industry formation. the pv industry emerged from a highly internationalized entrepreneurial project in which chinese firms directly mobilized knowledge, markets, investment and technology legitimacy developing outside china and combined them with the country's generic capabilities in mass-manufacturing. in some industries, globalization thus enables a new model of industry formation that heavily draws heavily on extra-regional system resources.\",\"interaction between energy incumbents and solar entrants: relationship status complicated. this paper contributes to the conceptualization of niche-regime interaction through a retrospective study of the evolution of business relationships between new entrant solar firms and incumbent municipal electric utilities in sweden. we analyse how activity links, resource ties and actor bonds evolve over time and discuss the resulting interactions. we find that the relationships initially created mutual benefits, combining utilities\\u2019 brands and sales channels with solar firms\\u2019 technology competences. most collaborations later turned into conflict due to the solar firms\\u2019 strengthened network positions and the clash between their private sector logic and the utilities\\u2019 public sector logic. conceptually, we emphasize (1) changes in the relative importance of different resources (technology-related interactions), (2) decreased alignment of goals, strategies, and values (institution-related interactions), and (3) shifts in the relative power of new entrants vis-\\u00e0-vis incumbents (network-related interactions). this leads us to question the common association of niches with new entrants and regimes with incumbents.\",\"spatial diffusion and the formation of a technological innovation system in the receiving country: the case of wind energy in portugal. this paper investigates how energy technologies diffuse spatially through the examination of wind growth in denmark (core) and portugal (follower). the research draws on the empirical historical scaling dynamics to compare patterns of diffusion, and proposes an explanation for these patterns with the help of the technological innovation systems (tis) theoretical framework. the analysis uncovered an acceleration of diffusion when the technology attained the new market. the mechanisms that allowed rapid adoption were found to be, among others, transnational linkages and an improved absorptive capacity. the latter benefited from past investments in knowledge development, imports of state-of-the-art technology and construction of a local industry assembling available competencies. targeted policies (e.g. tender-based feed-in scheme) were effective to stimulate technology transfer and boost diffusion. the linkages with the global tis and the concept of absorptive capacity improve the understanding of the processes involved in the formation of a tis in receiving countries.\",\"innovation in the long run: perspectives on technological transitions in sweden 1908\\u20132016. there are fundamental unresolved questions about the nature of the long-run interplay between innovation and economic development processes. this study examines technological transitions in sweden, 1908\\u20132016, using a new literature-based innovation output indicator for the engineering industry, allowing a mixed-methods approach. the results suggest that waves of innovation have taken place during periods of investment downturns and structural crises during the 1930s, 1970s, and 2010s. closer examination indicates that landscape pressure alone cannot explain the pattern. rather, the pattern can be explained by multi-regime interactions: infrastructure and industry rationalization, acting as a fertile ground for breakthrough innovations when the crisis breaks out. the results support a historical interpretation of long-run transitions in terms of development blocks and three industrial revolutions, with implications for the assessment of current sustainable transitions. this suggests a crucial role for infrastructures and interactions between socio-technical systems, not least between digital and renewable energy technology.\",\"do existing regional specialisations stimulate or hinder diversification into cleantech?. using data on patent applications, this paper provides systematic evidence of how the existing regional knowledge base, and in particular specialisation in fossil fuel technologies, affected both initial and subsequent regional diversification into cleantech knowledge production in european regions between 1987 and 2010. results confirmed the assumption in evolutionary economic geography that technological relatedness enhances regional diversification into cleantech. contrary to what is often assumed in the transitions literature, no indication whatsoever was found that a specialization in fossil fuel technologies hampered cleantech knowledge production in european regions. some clean technologies even partly developed out of fossil fuel knowledge. these empirical results suggest the need for a more heterogeneous socio-technical regime concept which facilitates new technology developments in some dimensions but hinders it in others.\",\"the institutional evolution process of the global solar industry: the role of public and private actors in creating institutional shifts. this study takes an institutional perspective on industry creation, which argues that an industry's maturation relies on a process of building legitimacy and establishing rules for competition. it addresses the institutional evolution process that an industry experiences, in which existing rules for competition are disrupted and replaced by new regulatory frameworks, technological standards, and business models. these interruptions are referred to as institutional shifts. the study seeks to understand the role of specific actors in creating institutional shifts that drive an industry's institutional evolution process. based on a study of the global solar industry over the period of 1982\\u20132012, the findings suggest that the industry's institutional evolution was driven by an interplay of different public and private actors that influenced one another over time and across national borders. to create institutional shifts, companies employed a mechanism based on knowledge diffusion, while governments used a stimuli-based mechanism instead.\",\"dynamics of a policy-driven market: the co-evolution of technological innovation systems for solar photovoltaics in china and germany. the rise of chinese solar energy firms has taken many experts by surprise. german policy makers and researchers alike had suggested that the country's ambitious deployment policies would translate into a competitive advantage for the german solar photovoltaics industry. this paper argues that these expectations rested on an outdated model of the international diffusion of innovation. building on the technological innovation system (tis) framework and the related system functions approach, the paper thus proposes a new approach for capturing the global dynamics of innovation and industrial development in emerging technology fields. focusing on a period of dynamic growth in the field of crystalline-based pv technologies, the paper highlights how a set of dynamic and mutual inter-dependencies between an industrialized country (i.e. germany) and an emerging economy (i.e. china) have driven the development and diffusion of technology in the field.\",\"characteristics of investors in onshore wind power in sweden. in order to facilitate the transition to electricity industries with low co2 emissions, it is important to understand which firms invest in renewable energy technologies. this study concentrates on the heterogeneous characteristics of investors in wind power that are embedded in the investors\\u2019 dynamic capabilities. data on 617 investors in the swedish onshore wind industry are analyzed. investors with higher investment and management experience and a mixed generation portfolio whose business is electricity production have more assets in wind. investors\\u2019 age in the wind industry has a negative relation with assets in wind, illustrating that latecomers are investing more. individual incumbents of the electricity industry hold a relatively large amount of assets in the swedish wind industry, but the group of incumbents as a whole possesses only 15 percent of wind assets. the results suggest that tailor-made policies could stimulate a greater variety of firms to invest in wind power.\",\"established industries as foundations for emerging technological innovation systems: the case of solar photovoltaics in norway. this paper follows up on recent debates on relations between technological innovation systems (tiss) and context. particular focus is placed on the role of established industries, which possess important resources for tis formation. the paper contributes in two ways. first, the paper builds and expands upon the tis framework to encompass beneficial relations between a tis and its sectoral and technological context. second, the framework is applied to the analysis of the emergence of a solar photovoltaic (pv) industry in norway. the analysis first illustrates how an emerging tis can benefit from an overlap with an established industry, which serves as a structural foundation and impacts key tis processes. second, the paper shows how relations between tis and context change over time and range from supply chain interaction to more profound overlaps of system elements.\",\"unleashing the industrial transformative capacity of innovations. this paper investigates the conditions in which the development of new technologies induce structural change in the economy. a literature review reveals three factors that influence the industrial transformative capacity of a technology: context; complementarities; competition. we explore the dynamics of these factors, focusing on the extent and nature of induced activities in adjacent sectors. we apply this framework to study marine renewable energy technologies (mret) in portugal. adjacent sector firms active in several mret exhibited diversified activity, innovation and internal change. comparing with norway, where an offshore sector (oil & gas) supports the emergence of offshore wind, the absence of such sector in portugal raises challenges but also creates opportunities for the transformation of several other sectors. we develop a new indicator to identify and compare the industrial transformative capacity of innovations. finally, we discuss the extent to which context, complementarities and competition contribute to accelerate or hinder transformative change.\",\"measuring the duration of formative phases for energy technologies. innovation processes during the early period of a technology's development establish the conditions for widespread commercialization. for comparative analysis of innovation processes across technologies, a common operational definition of the formative phase is needed. this paper develops a set of indicators to measure the start and end points of formative phases with reference to key innovation processes including experimentation and market formation. the indicators are then applied to measure the formative phase durations of sixteen energy technologies covering a range of historical periods and applications. formative phases are found to last 22 years on average. determinants of formative phase duration are explored. duration does not appear to be explained by unit scale, up-scaling, nor initial cost. however, technologies that are ready substitutes for incumbents have shorter formative phases, ceteris paribus. policy implications include the potentials and risks of accelerating formative phases to push low carbon technologies into the market.\",\"knowledge spillovers from renewable energy technologies: lessons from patent citations. this paper studies the knowledge spillovers generated by renewable energy technologies, unraveling the technological fields that benefit from knowledge developed in storage, solar, wind, marine, hydropower, geothermal, waste and biomass energy technologies. using citation data of patents in renewable technologies filed at 18 european patent offices over the 1978\\u20132006 period, the analysis examines the importance of knowledge flows within the same specific technological field (intra-technology spillovers), to other technologies in the field of power-generation (inter-technology spillovers), and to technologies unrelated to power-generation (external-technology spillovers). the results show significant differences across various technologies. overall, patents in wind, storage and solar technologies tend to be more frequently cited than other technologies. while wind technologies mainly find applications within their own field, a large share of innovations in solar energy and storage technologies find applications outside the field of power generation. the paper discusses the implications of these results for policymaking.\",\"a media-based innovation indicator: examining declining technological innovation systems. the recently introduced technological innovation system (tis) life cycle allows analyzing the decline of mature technologies. this study complements the associated empirical indicators by proposing a novel text-based innovation output indicator based on the media's role in forming collective expectations. we process more than 15,000 english news articles to capture the media's reporting on technological improvements of the internal combustion engine (ice). our results depict an increasing number of innovation articles with positive sentiment until 2015. more recently, we observe a decrease in innovation articles. along with the decreasing ice sales and performance data, this weakening support of the media for the tis innovation output suggests a possible misalignment with collective expectations that could lead to a vicious decline cycle. our study offers a real-time indicator for monitoring innovation strategies and develops a methodological framework to derive technology-specific innovation indicators on the firm-level using unsupervised topic modelling and sentiment analysis.\",\"broadening the national focus in technological innovation system analysis: the case of offshore wind. this paper empirically explores if and how the spatial dimensions of technological innovation system matter using the case of offshore wind in north-western europe. in particular, it demonstrates the territory-specific institutional embeddedness and transnational linkages effects between four national offshore wind innovation systems. the paper discusses the consequences of taking these spatial dimensions into account in the analysis of the domestic tis performance. it argues that the acknowledgement of these dimensions contributes to better understanding of the systems' dynamics and leads to policy advice that is in sync with recent internationalisation developments in the diffusion of the offshore wind industry.\",\"how the policy mix impacts innovation: findings from company case studies on offshore wind in germany. transforming the energy system to one with a greater importance of renewables requires redirecting and accelerating technological change. in this transition, so-called policy mixes play a crucial role. yet precisely how policy mixes affect technological innovation remains poorly understood. to remedy this, in this study we choose a qualitative company case study approach to analyze the innovation impact of a comprehensive policy mix, taking offshore wind in germany as research case. we find that the feed-in tariff level and the perceived consistency and credibility of the german offshore wind policy mix have been vital innovation drivers. specifically, the consistent and stable policy strategy with its long-term targets, and the consistency of the instrument mix with this policy strategy appear crucial to rd&d. in contrast, adoption decisions depend on a comprehensive and consistent instrument mix. finally, a high level of credibility can partly offset negative effects of inconsistencies in the mix.\",\"technological innovation system analysis in a follower country \\u2013 the case of offshore wind in poland. we assess the offshore wind innovation system in poland using the technological innovation system (tis) approach. this procedure has been widely used to describe the offshore wind innovation systems in europe. however, the literature concerned european countries located at the technological frontier, while we examine this issue in a follower country, which is still waiting to deploy first offshore wind installation. the upcoming transition of energy system makes poland a promising market for renewable technologies, and the geographical location places poland as the main actor in kick-starting the offshore wind market on the baltic sea. however, in our study we identify a number of challenges for offshore wind technology deployment in poland. some of them include unpredictable public policies, limited grid infrastructure, rather poor quality of research and weak interactions between science and business. to address these issues, we propose a set of policy instruments. we also outline two main observations resulting from the tis analysis applied to a follower country. first, the formulation of an appropriate policy decision is a precondition for the adoption of a new technology in a follower country, especially in sectors such as the energy sector. second, due to the importance of imitation, we identify the relationship between entrepreneurial experimentation and knowledge exchange across geographical borders as critical for the innovation system's performance in a follower country.\",\"non-disruptive regime changes\\u2014the case of competing energy efficient lighting trajectories. technologies within the same industry are expected to follow similar patterns of innovation, and when the dominant patterns change, this is often expected to have disruptive effects on the industry. however, the three most recent lighting technologies (fluorescent, compact fluorescent, and led) show different patterns of innovative activities despite similarities in the determinants of innovation; and we observed multiple technological regimes within the lighting industry. furthermore, we observed changes in these innovative patterns without widespread disruptive effects. while fl and led quickly improved once they were introduced, cfl struggled for decades. we present an historical case study of the emergence and development of the different regimes and we present possible explanations to be found in market structure and selection criteria. the analysis shows the important role for policymakers in stimulating new technologies in industries with undesirable mark ii pattern through the influence of all the dimensions of the technological regimes.\",\"international markets and technological innovation systems: the case of offshore wind. this research addresses the challenging question of how to support industry formation policies without relying on expensive domestic market formation strategies. innovation systems literature classically focuses on the need to support home market development to encourage both technological diffusion and generation of a promising technology. however, it is possible to decouple these notions in a national context under certain conditions. through in-depth interviews with key stakeholders in the dutch offshore wind industry, we unearth the conditions for young and established firms to access international markets in the absence of a home market. we determine that established firms can access international markets without significant hinderances or domestic support and can help form the backbone of an emerging industry. young firms are dependent on a well-functioning innovation system, which facilitates international market access through three pathways: 1) via local incumbents; 2) direct access to international markets; 3) via protected niche-spaces.\",\"windows of opportunity for catching up in formative clean-tech sectors and the rise of china in concentrated solar power. we analyse the potential for industry entry and catching up by latecomer countries or firms in formative sectors, by deriving a framework that builds on the concept of windows of opportunity for catching up. this framework highlights differences in technological, market, and institutional characteristics between formative and mature sectors, and elaborates how this may affect opportunities for catching up. we apply this framework to the global concentrated solar power sector, in which china has rapidly narrowed the gap to the global forefront in terms of technological capabilities and market competitiveness. we find that the formative nature of the sector resulted in turbulent development of the technological, market, and institutional dimensions, making it more difficult for early leaders to retain leadership, and therefore easier for latecomer firms or countries to catch up. this signals an increased role in early-stage technology development in the next phase of the energy transition.\",\"comparing the innovation strategies of chinese and european wind turbine firms through a patent lens. based on a patent-analysis method, this paper compares the firm-level technology pathways of wind turbine firms from china and europe, and examines the firms\\u2019 unique innovation strategies that may lead to these pathways being modified to capitalize on any opportunities that arise. this paper finds that chinese firms have different firm-level pathways compared to their european counterparts, whereby they are influenced by different innovation strategies that involve technological foci, learning, and r&d collaboration, as well as globalization strategies. we find that european firms are stronger in most of these strategic dimensions, while chinese firms demonstrate a strong learning capacity and customized innovations. we propose that there might be a limited divergence of the sector-level technological trajectories between china and europe. in addition, we suggest that there is limited opportunity for chinese firms to leapfrog with regard to the existing technology trajectories and surpass their european counterparts in the near future.\",\"offshore oil and gas firms' involvement in offshore wind: technological frames and undercurrents. it is commonly acknowledged that the actions and strategies of energy incumbents are important to understand sustainable energy transitions, but few studies have focused on why incumbent firms diversify into emerging sustainable energy sectors. this paper, which is based on a substantial empirical material, contributes to understand the dynamics between mature and emerging industry sectors by analysing the motivation of offshore oil and gas (o&g) sector firms' to engage in offshore wind (ow). at the surface, we find that o&g sector firms frame ow as an opportunity to exploit and develop existing resources in a new market, which they expect will grow significantly over the coming decades. furthermore, we find that the frame o&g managers apply when assessing ow is influenced by something we term 'undercurrents', as a significant motivation behind some investments in ow is to attract and develop human resources for use in the o&g sector.\",\"understanding successive industrial revolutions: a \\u201cdevelopment block\\u201d approach. this paper provides a reappraisal of the literature on \\u201clong waves\\u201d and \\u201cgeneral purpose technologies\\u201d. this approach is still widely used to characterize long run trends of technological change and economic development since the first industrial revolution. notwithstanding providing some useful insights, it is argued that this approach is rooted in a too rigid historical chronology positing a tight connection between technological change to economic outcomes. on these grounds, the paper suggests that a more flexible interpretative framework based on the notion of successive industrial revolutions and \\u201cdevelopment blocks\\u201d may offer a more accurate historical account and be more useful for providing insights for innovation and sustainability policies.\",\"the regional facet of a global innovation system: exploring the spatiality of resource formation in the value chain for onshore wind energy. onshore wind energy can be conceptualized as a \\u201cglobal innovation system\\u201d in which resources drive technological development and diffusion: knowledge, markets, investment and legitimacy. this paper investigates the regional embeddedness of resource formation along the industry's value chain, and explores how these processes are coupled to each other and to the national and global scale. empirically, the contribution focusses on a well-developed region within the gis and highlights different spatial patterns of resource formation: turbine manufacturing is characterized by spatially sticky knowledge and price-driven global valuation. the diffusion of the technology by downstream value chain and service-based firms reveals different processes: knowledge for turbine management and system integration is similarly footloose and sticky. the regional level is vital for market formation (siting decisions) and technological legitimation (community acceptance). these valuation processes rest on distinct and diverse kinds of knowledge, and are interlinked, customized and facilitated by regional actor networks.\",\"china's role in the next phase of the energy transition: contributions to global niche formation in the concentrated solar power sector. the role that emerging economies, and china in particular, play in the global energy transition appears to be transforming. transition literature to date characterizes the formation of cleantech sectors in emerging economies as being heavily dependent on foreign inputs of knowledge and other key resources. this article argues that in the, currently unfolding, next phase of the global energy transition, chinese actors may play a more central role in global niche development for high-tech industries, including in constructing innovative and effective socio-technical configurations. this argument is illustrated with a case study of the chinese concentrated solar power industry, which is found to have developed largely independently of foreign resources. the case is used to highlight a number of specificities of the chinese environment that set it apart from niche formation environments in oecd countries, and may allow china to open up technological trajectories unlikely to develop in those oecd countries.\",\"solar business model adoption by energy incumbents: the importance of strategic fit. this paper answers recent calls to give more attention to the business strategies of incumbent actors regarding innovation and socio-technical transitions. we map the solar business model adoption of 30 swedish electric utility incumbents and examine to what extent it can be explained by the strategic fit with the utilities' established business models, corporate strategies, and external environment. we find that all three dimensions need to be considered in order to explain adoption. alignment with the established business model is mainly important concerning activities, resources, and partnerships, and utilities also re-configure solar models to increase this alignment (e.g. through outsourcing). however, it is not the main driver for adoption. instead, incentives and pressures related to corporate strategies and external environment induce or block retailers from adopting solar models. by demonstrating the importance of strategic fit, these findings provide a more nuanced understanding of industry incumbent's strategies in relation to emerging technologies.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"4_firms_innovation_chinese\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"4_firms_innovation_chinese\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[12.704669952392578,11.795433044433594,11.6123628616333,12.476054191589355,11.624129295349121,11.945869445800781,11.797080039978027,11.745820999145508,12.677488327026367,11.539868354797363,12.040169715881348,11.737082481384277,12.23300838470459,11.189459800720215,12.4761962890625,12.586055755615234,12.476045608520508,11.562982559204102,12.494597434997559,11.845197677612305,12.416221618652344,12.62814998626709,11.629833221435547,12.471220016479492,11.871091842651367,11.647186279296875,12.047048568725586],\"y\":[5.688006401062012,5.817128658294678,5.670010089874268,5.577561378479004,6.03866720199585,5.780171871185303,5.693109512329102,5.742102146148682,5.647964000701904,5.913628101348877,5.85124397277832,5.741044998168945,5.704357147216797,5.780063629150391,5.599369525909424,5.660088539123535,5.605371475219727,5.726139545440674,5.628232955932617,5.776388168334961,5.629337787628174,5.635889053344727,6.073253631591797,5.608179092407227,5.796835899353027,5.654743671417236,5.732264518737793],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"institutional

platform and ask for government permission only later. we analyze the emergence of uber as an institutional entrepreneur in the netherlands and the strategies it employed in a failed attempt to get its uberpop service legalized through changes in dutch taxi law. we conclude that uber's failure to change the dutch taxi law stemmed from the difficulty to leverage pragmatic legitimacy among users into favorable regulatory changes in a highly institutionalized regime, because uber's institutional work strategies were not aligned.\",\"market intermediation and its embeddeness \\u2013 lessons from the finnish energy transition. energy transitions are in many respects past the early exploration stages and moving towards the urgently needed mass market take-up. we examine the finnish energy transition regarding how solutions \\u2013 heat-pumps, deep retrofits and new district-wide solutions \\u2013 that have demonstrated economic benefits and reasonable payback times have faced slow uptake and slow market development. we focus on the difficulties that suppliers and adopters face in establishing the value and singularization of goods when adopters need to act as calculative agents in the market. when the intermediation processes needed for market development do not cover the all the needed aspects, these market difficulties can persist until late in the transition process. we further elaborate how the intermediation takes place in ecologies of actors that become complex once the complexity of goods grows and the intermediation becomes tied to formalized arenas such as those found in urban development. periodic assessment of the effectiveness of markets and ecologies of intermediation can inform policy interventions on market development.\",\"understanding the limits to forming policy-driven markets in the electricity sector. the formation of policy-pushed markets has been underexamined in the transition literature, despite their importance for achieving sustainability policy objectives and their greater risk of failure. this study draws from service-dominant logic, i.e., a marketing-originated meta-theory of markets, to explain why one of these policy-pushed markets\\u2014local energy flexibility markets\\u2014may not develop. in particular, we show that to decide whether to participate in these policy-pushed markets, market actors assess the resources available to them, anticipate the required interactions to integrate resources, and forecast potential value formation. actors\\u2019 limited ability to identify or access resources, and/or their unwillingness or inability to interact with other actors to integrate resources explain why value processes do not unfold so that the market does not develop. we also demonstrate that existing institutional arrangements may limit actors\\u2019 agency to access to resources or coordinate value flows, which prevents the policy-pushed market from self-adjustment.\",\"sustainable market transformation: a refined framework for analyzing causal loops in transitions to sustainability. this article proposes a refined conceptual framework to understand and act upon sustainable market transformation processes. currently, there is a knowledge gap between government-oriented approaches to transition management and market formation that is addressed in evolutionary economics. consequently, this article builds upon literature in the field of evolutionary economics, systems theory and transition management, to conceptualize the causal loops which trigger collective behavior facing sustainability issues. furthermore, it proposes how these causal loops can be altered by interventions of actors in four sequential transition phases and illustrates what kind of interventions are most effective to accelerate a sustainable market transformation process. promising avenues for future empirical studies based on the suggested conceptual framework, are the investigation of how the concepts of sustainable market transformation are applied in different market contexts and the evaluation of whether the applied interventions actually alter the underlying causal loops.\",\"market formation in a global health transition. transition studies have started to focus on market formation in innovation systems. this article investigates market formation in a global health transition that was instigated by drug-resistant malaria. we explore how markets for artemisinin-based combination therapies (act) in the greater mekong subregion (gms) were formed at multiple geographical scales and locations. the study reveals the role of public institutes, academia and partnerships in early innovation system development. it demonstrates how transnational organizations created a supportive global landscape for act development and deployment. it then reveals how these advancements led to the formation of public-sector and private-sector act markets in the gms. we illustrate how market formation activities took place on global, national and local scales and how structural couplings enabled the functioning of this global innovation system. the lessons learned are particularly relevant now that drug-resistant malaria has once more emerged in the gms, urgently calling for new therapies and associated end-user markets.\",\"conceptualizing market formation for transformative policy. transitions are hardly conceivable without understanding how new markets are formed. however, there is still an incipient conceptualization of market formation in the context of transformation and transformative policy. drawing on existing perspectives of market formation in economics of innovation, sociology of markets and marketing studies literature, this paper develops a framework for characterizing, differentiating and analyzing new market formation processes. we use three case studies to demonstrate how the framework is able to capture the dynamic and interconnected nature of market formation. the market formation framework serves to diagnose potential misalignments, bottlenecks and failures, to identify entry points for policy to intervene in market formation and support transformative innovation.\",\"shaping sustainable markets\\u2014a conceptual framework illustrated by the case of biogas in sweden. by merging findings from transition studies with recent literature on market-shaping, this paper outlines a conceptual framework that describes the shaping of sustainable markets. the framework comprises three critical processes: enabling exchange practices, proving the system and constructing the narrative. individually, these processes generate different kinds of value \\u2013 traded, demonstrated and expected value \\u2013 and the value output from each process serves as input to the other two processes. hence the value streams link the processes together. we illustrate the framework by analyzing market-shaping processes for biogas in sweden. the case analysis shows how public and private actors have engaged in a multitude of activities that have built up the market-shaping processes. the analysis highlights the recursive nature of sustainable market-shaping, showing how key actors must repeatedly respond to tensions resulting from growth and aspirations of growth.\",\"the role of governments in uncertainty orchestration in market formation for sustainability transitions. market formation in sustainability transitions is characterised by deep and longstanding uncertainty. albeit prior research provides a rich repertoire of theoretical frameworks on how incumbent firms and entrepreneurs deal with uncertainty, there is still scant literature on the role of the government in orchestrating uncertainty concerning market formation. by studying multiple cases involving an innovation agency and municipalities in brazil, we propose a new framework composed of a distinguishing typology of uncertainties and patterns of actions regarding how the government can orchestrate the mitigation of these uncertainties in market formation in sustainability transitions. government actors cope with configurational uncertainty through boundary experimentation, affiliation uncertainty by removing barriers, and interdependence uncertainty by setting long-term mechanisms (nurturing, facilitating and driving interdependence). our framework suggests that government actors adopt strategies to increase their legitimacy in driving market formation under uncertainty and use epistemic regulation to mitigate hypes. implications and opportunities for further research are also discussed.\",\"introducing the lens of markets-in-the-making to transition studies: the case of the danish wind power market agencement. this paper contributes to a renewed understanding of markets in transition studies by focusing on how unknown things must be \\u2018framed\\u2019 and pacified in order to be attributed some \\u2018value\\u2019 that makes them \\u2018matter\\u2019. we empirically analyze the making of a market agencement for wind power deployment in denmark. using an analytical framework of framing and pacifying, we trace three entangled \\u2018domains of action\\u2019 associated with the employment of (a) sociopolitical devices to enable the discursive valuation of wind power, (b) economic devices to develop price-setting models for investors, and (c) technical devices to facilitate grid integration, thereby framing wind power as socio-politically, economically, and techno-scientifically \\u2018valuable\\u2019, respectively. this market agencement has consistently produced concerns (i.e., overflows) requiring constant re-framing. we discuss how the lens of markets-in-the-making can contribute to transition studies. by showing how the domains of action entangle and \\u2018overflow\\u2019 onto each other, this study demonstrates that the relational lens of socio-technical agencements can help shed additional light on the dynamics and agency of markets in transition.\",\"using lead market factors to assess the potential for a sustainability transition. this paper considers how the lead market concept can contribute towards analysing system transformation as described by the multi-level perspective (mlp). lead market arguments for the export potential of eco-innovations can provide an argument for policy support for environmental niches. international policy diffusion and learning across countries on the level of niche-regime interaction can improve the legitimacy of supporting policies. we propose how eco-innovation can be framed within an integrated mlp-lead market approach. eco-innovations address two classes of regimes (infrastructure and eco-efficiency), which are likely to follow different transition pathways. the use of indicators for lead market factors for empirically analysing the opportunities for system transformation in the mlp framework is assessed. indicators for the lead market factors can be attributed to the mlp. however, some of the indicators are more general in nature and do only indirectly point towards system transformation towards eco-innovations.\",\"markets as leverage points for transformations of economic systems: the example of the german bioeconomy. this paper discusses a method for the identification of leverage points for the transformation of complex economic systems by combining value chain analysis and a relational perspective on markets. we introduce the network of markets

economy, is chosen to exemplify the application of the method. here, we provide the specific rationales behind our approach and identify possible key markets for governance interventions in the transformation toward a bio-based economy in germany.\",\"introduction to \\u2018markets in sustainability transitions\\u2019. if sustainability transitions research is to be relevant for upscaled diffusion of radical innovations and wide systemic socio-technical changes, then markets remain critical to account for. founding frameworks in transition studies regard markets and market formation as important. yet, the conceptualization of markets has so far not been elaborate: markets are mostly pictured as target areas for sustainable innovation and emphasis is on diffusion and user involvement. this special issue aims to unpack the notion of markets and market formation in sustainability transitions. the special issue contains in total 13 papers, which draw on theory from various scientific disciplines, use diverse research approaches, and cover a multitude of contexts. altogether, the collection of papers stimulates broader theorizing of markets in sustainability transitions and the formulation of an agenda for future studies on markets in sustainability transitions. this editorial paper proposes relevant topics for such a research agenda.\",\"it's not the market, stupid: on the importance of non-market economies in sustainability transitions. it has been widely assumed that market mechanisms are central in incentivizing the development of sustainable innovations and that market formation is critical for the diffusion of innovations. we challenge the centrality of markets in understanding and promoting the development and diffusion of sustainable innovations using the case of the system of rice intensification. this innovation for sustainable rice cultivation was developed and diffused without relying on market mechanisms yet has been adopted by millions of farmers worldwide. to further our understanding of economic mechanisms beyond markets, we revisit polanyi's distinction between markets, reciprocity, redistribution, and subsistence. this distinction helps to situate markets in a broader economic context and helps to understand how mechanisms for market exchange intersect with other types of economies in ways that can either positively or negatively affect sustainability.\",\"an evolving risk perspective for policy instrument choice in sustainability transitions. we develop the concept of evolving risk to demonstrate that the optimal policy choice between price and quantity instruments may change over time. drawing from system innovation, evolutionary concepts and modern financial and transaction cost economics, we analyze dynamic cost and welfare impacts of instrument choice under uncertainty. in early market deployment of niche technologies, economic and system-innovation arguments suggest price instruments can stabilize revenues and decrease market risks for investors. this accelerates deployment without necessarily compromising economic efficiency. protective policies that work well for niche technologies should, however, be used cautiously during market upscaling and diffusion, due to the changing nature of risks. we use theoretic arguments and a case to demonstrate that a gradual shift towards quantity control may become preferable for welfare maximization under certain circumstances. solar photovoltaics in germany serves as illustrative case, where auctions (a form of quantity control) succeeded feed-in tariffs (a price instrument).\",\"market formation in the context of transitions: a comment on the transitions agenda. transition studies has recently underscored the need to focus on upscaling and diffusion of innovations. a key question is how these innovations, already existing in niche markets, can become diffused and embedded in broader markets. as a first step, we offer ideas about the design and formation of what one might call \\u2018markets for transitions\\u2019. we argue that less attention has been paid to legitimized perceptions of market boundaries, the roles of actors, the interplay between markets, and the process character of market formation.\",\"neoliberalism and the legality of peer platform markets. online platforms for rentals and services raise difficult legal issues. nevertheless, some commentators have been quick to dismiss these issues or to argue that the laws themselves are the problem. this article traces the intellectual sources of these responses. it argues that these sources can generally be identified with neoliberalism, including its description of markets as both spontaneous and institutionally constructed as well as a distinction between laws that provide infrastructure for markets and laws that interfere with markets. cyberlibertarianism and \\u201csharing economy\\u201d discourse also play a role. however, there are flaws in these theoretical premises and in their application in this context. while there exist sound bases for critiques of certain regulatory regimes, the assumption that the platforms are, on the whole, more freedom-enhancing and more efficient than state regulation cannot be sustained. nor can it be assumed that the benefits of these markets will be widely distributed.\",\"a network perspective to niche-regime interactions and learning at the regime level. this study proposes an analytical approach to niche-regime-interactive learning, taking an

products in supermarkets. its novelty is two-fold: 1) it integrates the notion of learner levels into the mlp, differentiating between learning-in and -by regime; 2) it proposes a different understanding of learning loops than usually found in st studies, by considering them as encompassing both processes and outcomes. the paper makes both theoretical and empirical contributions: 1) it helps to elaborate multi-stakeholder learning; 2) it enables capturing learning dynamics within and between sub-system and system levels; 3) it helps to elucidate knowledge-power issues learning is subjected to; 4) it elucidates the value of this network perspective empirically, illustrating its descriptive and explanatory power in helping to further the knowledge on learning at the regime

opinion surveys. in diametrical opposition to standard predictions, the theory of lead markets conjectures potential competitiveness gains from environmental regulation. evidence for the actual impact direction and its determinants has however so far been inconclusive. examining different regulation characteristics and distinguishing between their long-term and short-term effects brings the two seemingly contradictory concepts in line. based on executive opinion surveys that are annually conducted by the wef and the imd, country-level competitiveness effects are evaluated and the determinants are estimated in a panel regression. the estimation results call for a flexible regulation design that allows for different ways of achieving compliance. the fact that regulatory pressure is found to be strongly associated with a more positive perception of long-term impacts lends support to the induced-innovation-hypothesis. while controlling for potential effects from affluence, market size and trade openness, the impact on long-term competitiveness seems also to be affected by environmental quality institutions.\",\"the diffusion of environmental product and service

innovation in demand response firms: beyond the niche-regime dichotomy. demand response (dr) is an innovation emerging at the intersection of the energy and information and communications technology sectors. this paper aims to investigate the drivers of\\u2014and differences in\\u2014business model innovation (bmi) behaviours of firms operating in these two interacting industries. results from 22 semi-structured interviews with representatives of finnish dr companies show that external drivers of bmi include regulation, competition, and the demise of the telecom industry following the fall of nokia. whereas technology start-ups and companies from adjacent industries are motivated by entrepreneurial opportunities, incumbent energy companies are driven by the threat of losing their existing customers and need to increase efficiency. the bmi behaviours observed do not fall neatly into the often-used dichotomous categories of niche/new entrant and regime/incumbent, as firms show behaviours from both extremes. to overcome this binary thinking, we propose a morphological box model that represents the extreme states of firm bmi while allowing for flexibility.\",\"empirical determinants of eco-innovation in european countries using the community innovation survey. the determinants of eco-innovation activities have been widely explored for single countries. however, there is a lack of analyses comparing different countries. the community innovation survey (cis 2008) allows for an analysis of the determinants of eco-innovation in 19 different european countries. this paper focuses on eastern europe as the determinants of eco-innovation have not yet been systematically analyzed for these countries. concerning the introduction of eco-innovations, this analysis shows that regulation activities and environmentally related subsidies seem to be more important for the eastern countries than they are for the \\\"richer\\\" western european countries. furthermore, the eastern european countries rely more on competitors and external r&d as information sources, indicating a technology transfer from west to east.\",\"regional lead markets for environmental innovation. the success of environmental innovations and sustainability transitions critically depends on market formations and diffusion processes. as of today, the geography of transitions literature provides suitable terms and case study evidence that these processes are highly regional phenomena. however, pertinent conceptual frameworks such as the multi-level perspective, technological innovation systems, or the somewhat less prominent lead market concept lack an explicit regional perspective. this paper develops a regionalized framework (\\u2018regional lead markets (rlm)\\u2019) in order to provide a more appropriate conceptual lens for analyses of regional transition and innovation diffusion processes. we argue that regional lead markets are determined by regulatory advantages, demand advantages and technological advantages. a regional lead market adopts a later successful innovation at an early stage and gains competitive advantage in the respective industry, driving national and international diffusion. we demonstrate the concept's applicability by providing illustrative evidence on shanghai's lead market potential for waste management.\",\"effects of third-party information on the demand for more sustainable consumption: a choice experiment on the transition of winter tourism. sustainability transitions involve a dynamic interaction of regulation, innovation, and preferences for new products. in this study we examine consumer preferences as a potential driver of supply side innovations in the winter tourism industry. we use a novel survey approach that allows for heuristic decision-making based on information from third parties. specifically, we investigate consumer preferences when (i) only factual information and (ii) factual information and environmental ngo or consumer recommendations are available. the third-party information significantly affected the destination choices in about one third of the examined choice sets. the results indicate a willingness to pay for some of the examined sustainability attributes, and they point to specific differences among different tourist groups. regarding methodology we suggest that survey experiments involving third-party information are useful for the study of choices about product or policy innovations in dynamic markets where standard assumptions on preferences and rationality may not apply.\",\"the effects of climate policy on the rate and direction of innovation: a survey of the eu ets and the electricity sector. this article aims to empirically assess the impact of climate policy on technological change-a core objective of climate policy-by focussing on the changes it causes in the rate and direction of corporate innovation activities. to this end, we develop a cross-sectional framework based on concepts from evolutionary economics and organizational theory and, resting upon this framework, develop a set of hypotheses. we test these hypotheses using novel survey data on the electricity sector in seven eu countries. we find that the eu emission trading system (ets) has limited and even controversial effects, and that long-term emission reduction targets are an important determinant of corporate innovation activities. furthermore, technology policies emerge as an important element of the policy mix complementing climate policy. based on our findings in this study, we make recommendations for policy makers on how to improve the existing policy mix.\",\"what drives eco-innovation? a review of an emerging literature. this paper provides an overview of the emerging literature on the drivers of eco-innovation. its main contribution lies in separating the drivers associated with the phases of development and diffusion and in identifying particular drivers based on different eco-innovation types. we find that research in this area primarily adopts the resource-based and institutional theories as its theoretical foundations and that the prevailing effects identified are those of regulations and market pull factors. moreover, product eco-innovation, process eco-innovation, organizational eco-innovation, and environmental r&d investments seem to be driven by common drivers, such as regulations, market pull factors, ems, and cost savings, as well as to be positively associated with company size. the majority of the studies in our literature review employ a quantitative research methodology and focus on the diffusion stage of eco-innovation. we end with providing a synthesis of drivers of companies' eco-innovation and directions for future research.\",\"exploring car manufacturers' responses to technology-forcing regulation: the case of california's zev mandate. the ability of firms to influence environmental regulation has largely been overlooked in transition studies. we study how car manufacturers combine and change their innovation and political influence strategies in response to a technology-forcing regulation. we apply a conceptual framework on corporate responses to public innovation policy to the case of the zero emission vehicle mandate over the period 1990-2013. we use patent and sales data to operationalize the r&d and commercialization aspects of innovation strategies, while using corporate political activities data to operationalize political influence strategies. we find that first, car manufacturers used specific combinations of innovation and political influence strategies, depending on their value maintaining or value creating nature. second, manufacturers changed their strategies and became more value creating over time, which supported socio-technical change. third, we refine the available strategy typology by identifying subclasses in defensive (opposition and slowdown) and proactive strategies (shaping, support and progressive).\",\"environmental innovations in the eu: a club convergence analysis of the eco-innovation index and driving factors of the clusters. eco-innovation, which combines innovation and sustainable development, has become an essential instrument to strengthen economic growth and preserve the environment. considering the eco-innovation index for the eu, we study the convergence of eco-innovation across countries for the period 2012\\u20132021 through the club convergence approach. we evaluate if and to what extent eu countries are converging toward a homogenous eco-innovation dynamic pattern. our results indicate three clubs of convergence in the overall eco-innovation index, while the number of clusters is higher -four or five- in the five dimensions of the indicator. the analysis of the determinants of clubs in the aggregated index highlights the relevance of gdp per capita and economic openness, while r&d investments, environmental taxation and firm size are non-significant in our study. the results are also discussed within the contexts of convergence of environmental policies and innovation in the eu.\",\"diffusion of environmental innovations: sector differences and explanation range of factors. empirical research on the diffusion of environmental product and service innovations has significant limits: almost all investigations focus on just a single sector or technology, usually energy, and concern a small number of diffusion cases. therefore, it is hardly possible to generalize across sectors and to identify potential differences between sectors. we address this research gap with an investigation of a large sample of 130 diffusion cases from 11 different sectors. we apply a new mixed-method approach of statistical analysis and qualitative extreme case analysis. we provide insights on the differences in dissemination rates and knowledge on sector-specific factors. this helps to explain diffusion processes and design effective sector-specific transition policies. the concept of explanation range of factors clarifies the role and relevance of different diffusion factors and opens up avenues for further research on environmental innovation. based on our findings, it can be concluded that some factors explain diffusion in (almost) all cases (high explanatory range), some only in specific sectors (medium explanatory range), and some merely in individual cases (low explanatory range).\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"6_eco_environmental_innovation\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"6_eco_environmental_innovation\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[10.980735778808594,10.96507453918457,10.956711769104004,10.888716697692871,10.893448829650879,11.087307929992676,11.019123077392578,10.897841453552246,10.777607917785645,11.126925468444824,11.0101900100708,10.864659309387207,11.036409378051758,10.97980785369873,10.96318244934082],\"y\":[5.443576335906982,5.450498104095459,5.449853420257568,5.568925380706787,5.581081390380859,5.441628456115723,5.483356952667236,5.623901844024658,5.472908973693848,5.431467056274414,5.4979658126831055,5.442440032958984,5.491178035736084,5.483034610748291,5.4901299476623535],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"a mechanism-based explanation for blocking mechanisms in technological innovation systems. understanding \\u201csystemic problems\\u201d or \\u201cblocking mechanisms\\u201d in emerging technologies and industries has been a major issue in technological innovation systems (tis) research. despite this literature's long tradition, we show that a more accurate definition enhances the tis framework explanatory power for a higher diversity of empirical cases. we posit that conceptual improvement depends on addressing the unclear or incomplete definitions and the lack of explanation of interdependent systemic problems and blocking mechanisms. to this end, we apply a mechanism-based approach to explore these conceptual limitations. as a result, we propose a causal conceptual framework that understands blocking mechanisms as causal pathways linking systemic problems (causes) to poor system functioning (outcomes). we also argue that detailing the causal pathway in activities and respective actors better explains system malfunctioning. finally, we discuss patterns of interdependencies among systemic problems and blocking mechanisms and implications for methodologies and for informing policy.\",\"the study of institutional entrepreneurship and its implications for transition studies. innovations accompanying transitions often prompt institutional change if they do not match with existing institutions. transition studies started to incorporate institutional dynamics into their research, but efforts hitherto remain underdeveloped. in this paper, we systematically review the institutional entrepreneurship literature. based on a reading of 153 empirical cases, we identify trends and biases in the literature and we distil a number of insights for transition studies to engage with.\",\"influences of technological and sectoral contexts on technological innovation systems. this paper analyses how technological and sectoral context structures influence the functional pattern of a focal technological innovation system (tis), focusing on value chain interdependencies. through a case study of the \\u2018embryonic\\u2019 bio-succinate from mixed food waste tis in sweden, we show that all identified context structures exert both negative and positive influences on tis functions by influencing resource availability and accessibility, market conditions and the wider selection environment. contextual influences result from interdependencies throughout the value chain, but in contrast to previous studies, direct structural overlaps are not as relevant as competition for resources, markets and policy support. competition does not only come from the regime but also from other related tiss and sectors. the study also confirms the importance of contextual influences from the international tis. these findings suggest that a wide perspective on context structures and selection pressures should be considered in future research.\",\"system interactions in socio-technical transitions: extending the multi-level perspective. this paper discusses contextual issues in sociotechnical systems and transitions under the multi level perspective (mlp). it emphasises inter system interactions, for which a typology is developed drawing on a review and meta level analysis of published transition case studies. the typology is subsequently associated to the mlp transitions pathways. a novel transition pathway, is derived through this process, namely new system emergence, for systems that emerge from contributions of existing antecedent sociotechnical systems.\",\"branching innovation, recombinant innovation, and endogenous technological transitions. we propose a model of technological transitions based on two different types of innovations. branching innovations refer to technological improvements along a particular path, while recombinant innovations represent fusions of multiple paths. recombinant innovations create \\\"short-cuts\\\" which reduce switching costs allowing agents to escape a technological lock-in. as a result, recombinant innovations speed up technological progress allowing transitions that are impossible with only branching innovations. our model replicates some stylised facts of technological change, such as technological lock-in, experimental failure, punctuated change and irreversibility. furthermore, an extensive simulation experiment suggests that there is an optimal rate of innovation, which is strongly correlated with the number of recombination innovations. this underlines the pivotal role of technological variety as a seed for recombinant innovation leading to technological transitions.\",\"technology phase-out as unravelling of socio-technical configurations: cloud seeding case. deliberate technology phase-out is being recognised as a viable policy option to weaken incumbent socio-technical configurations. at the same time, phase-out as a phenomenon has not been the focus of much attention in innovation studies and science and technology studies, where interest in emergence of technologies dominates. this is puzzling because phase-outs of socio-technical configurations are real-world phenomena. we propose a conceptual framework to study the dynamics of phase-outs of socio-technical configurations drawing from social practice theory which offers specific, nuanced, yet simple heuristics to trace the multifaceted character of socio-technical configurations. we explore an historical case of an incomplete phase-out by revisiting cloud seeding technology in the us. we show how the incomplete phase-out of cloud seeding was reflected in incomplete disruption of linkages between the material, cognitive and symbolic elements of the configuration. this case shows how a technology once considered problematic can resurface and regain legitimacy.\",\"thresholds models of technological transitions. we present a systematic review of seven threshold models of technological transitions from physics, biology, economics and sociology. the very same phenomenon of a technological transition can be explained by very different logics, ranging from economic explanations based on price, performance and increasing returns to alternative explanations based on word-of-mouth recommendation, convergence of expectations, or social mimicking behaviour. our review serves as a menu for future modelling exercises that can take one or more elementary transition models as a basis, and extend these model to fit more specific sectoral, technological or territorial contexts.\",\"a system dynamics model of socio-technical regime transitions. formal modelling of sociotechnical transitions has so far focused either on reproducing known historical case studies or on generic transition models that encompass some of the characteristics of the underlying processes. this article presents a model that captures the unfolding dynamics of an existing technological regime and the emerging niches as they compete and respond to landscape pressures. the theoretical basis is the \\\"multi-level perspective\\\" (mlp) framework. the development of new technologies in niches is endogenous and stochastic. model analysis can be seen as a test of the dynamic consistency of the mlp substitution pathway. simulation results are consistent with what mlp theory suggests and raise relevant questions and insights for future modelling work on transition pathways and theory development.\",\"engaging with the politics, agency and structures in the technological innovation systems approach. questions whether the technological innovation systems approach can be used to study transitions. politics is a much more pervasive feature of transitions than 'legitimation'. weakness of systems approaches is that they pay insufficient attention to agency. tis approach fails to take into account structural rigidities in existing sectors. however, there is potential for a more politically informed tis analysis.\",\"the economics of transition pathways: a proposed taxonomy and a policy experiment. pathways of transition differ across countries, industrial sectors, firms and technologies, but little is known about the reasons for these differences and macroeconomic consequences. i show theoretically how differences in transition patterns and macroeconomic side effects can be explained by the characteristics of competing technologies. competing technologies are characterized by their relative superiority in an exogenous socio-technical landscape, their relative maturity and cross-technology interactions in the process of specialization. these characteristics are linked to the multi-layer perspective of transition theory and build the conceptual basis of technology in the macroeconomic agent-based model eurace@unibi-eco. it is shown that the characteristics can be an explanation for heterogeneous transition pathways. policy may alter the exogenous landscape conditions that surround technological competition. it is shown how different market-based instruments can be used to accelerate and stabilize a transition process. taxes and subsidies perform differently conditional on the characteristics of competing technologies.\",\"technological innovation systems in contexts: conceptualizing contextual structures and interaction dynamics. this paper addresses interactions between technological innovation systems (tis) and wider \\\"context structures\\\". while tis studies have always considered various kinds of contextual influences, we suggest that the tis framework can be further strengthened by a more elaborated conceptualization of tis context structures and tis-context interactions. for that purpose, we identify and discuss four especially important types of context structures: technological, sectorial, geographical and political. for each of these, we provide examples of different ways in which context structures can interact with a focal tis and how our understanding of tis dynamics is enhanced by considering them explicitly. lessons for analysts are given and a research agenda is outlined. 2015 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.\",\"the technological innovation systems framework: response to six criticisms. the technological innovation systems framework (tis) is widely used to study the emergence and growth of new technological fields and industries. at the same time, it has been criticized for a number of issues and innovation scholars have made suggestions of how to improve the framework. in this viewpoint, we respond to six areas of criticism: (1) tis context, (2) system delineation, (3) spatial aspects, (4) transitions, (5) politics, and (6) policy recommendations. we point to promising conceptual developments of how to address shortcomings and highlight needs for further research. we also discuss the prospects of the tis approach for the analysis of socio-technical transitions. the tis framework, in our view, has the potential to outgrow its original scope - explaining the dynamics and performance of a technological field - and to address many of the issues relevant when studying transitions.\",\"thinking about individual actor-level perspectives in sociotechnical transitions: a comment on the transitions research agenda. the 2019 strn research agenda identifies connecting the different 'levels' of transitions processes as a worthwhile line of work. individual actor-level processes are an example of those at the 'micro' level that are lost through the aggregation involved in high level sociotechnical transitions concepts. this short commentary discusses ways of connecting individual actor level processes to transitions concepts, where 'individual' refers to individual human actors. for this purpose, the commentary draws on social psychology and shows how this particular discipline is relevant to more than simply consumption and technology acceptance. the commentary also identifies more general strategies relevant to the bridging of levels, beyond psychology, namely: (i) the use of concepts that inherently bridge the individual and the social; and (ii) the use of multi-stage, sequenced studies that track the influence of different types of processes through particular sociotechnical systems.\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"7_tis_technological_sociotechnical\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"7_tis_technological_sociotechnical\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[10.817023277282715,10.961252212524414,11.067561149597168,8.888775825500488,11.103090286254883,8.846047401428223,10.996737480163574,10.835260391235352,10.940234184265137,10.997642517089844,11.010091781616211,10.981807708740234,8.860754013061523,10.485097885131836],\"y\":[6.3280110359191895,6.622669696807861,6.159377098083496,8.29621696472168,6.233598232269287,8.23759651184082,6.276812553405762,6.551239490509033,6.252385139465332,6.301692962646484,6.269143104553223,6.297196865081787,8.287100791931152,6.777925968170166],\"type\":\"scattergl\"}],

              "'systems of practice and the circular economy: transforming mobile phone product service systems. of late, policy and research attention has increasingly focused on making the circular economy a reality. a key part of this agenda is the creation of sustainable product service systems (spss) that meet consumers’ needs whilst lessening negative environmental impacts. although the spss literature has grown recently, key aspects require further examination. in response, this paper discusses empirical research exploring consumers’ reactions to a novel, hypothetical mobile phone spss, utilizing qualitative methods that included ‘business origami’. it examines consumers’ knowledge about current mobile phone life cycles, and responses to the proposed spss, drawing on a ‘systems of practice’ framework to discuss the potential for significant changes in phone purchase and use. it outlines barriers to alterations in practices, underscoring the centrality that connectivity and data storage now have in many peoples’ daily lives, which have for some become clustered around the capabilities and accessibility of the mobile phone.'"

I want you to identify the reearch topic of following documents, which are titles plus abstacts of scientific journal article publications.

The journal offers a platform for reporting studies of innovations and socio-economic transitions to enhance an environmentally sustainable economy and thus solve structural resource scarcity and environmental problems, notably related to fossil energy use and climate change. This involves attention for technological, organizational, economic, institutional and political innovations as well as economy-wide and sector changes, such as in the areas of energy, transport, agriculture and water management. The journal aims to tackle the most difficult questions, dealing with social, economic, behavioral-psychological and political barriers and opportunities as well as their complex interaction. The journal is multidisciplinary in spirit and methodologically open, and invites contributions from a broad range of disciplines within the social, environmental and innovation sciences. Specific research areas covered include: Theoretical analysis, formal modeling, empirical studies, policy discussion and a critical survey of relevant literature. Practical cases may address transitions in specific sectors, cities or regions. Articles on historical transitions not specifically related to environment and sustainability are welcome if they include a section with unique lessons for sustainability transitions.

            " - an evolving risk perspective for policy instrument choice in sustainability transitions. we develop the concept of evolving risk to demonstrate that the optimal policy choice between price and quantity instruments may change over time. drawing from system innovation, evolutionary concepts and modern financial and transaction cost economics, we analyze dynamic cost and welfare impacts of instrument choice under uncertainty. in early market deployment of niche technologies, economic and system-innovation arguments suggest price instruments can stabilize revenues and decrease market risks for investors. this accelerates deployment without necessarily compromising economic efficiency. protective policies that work well for niche technologies should, however, be used cautiously during market upscaling and diffusion, due to the changing nature of risks. we use theoretic arguments and a case to demonstrate that a gradual shift towards quantity control may become preferable for welfare maximization under certain circumstances. solar photovoltaics in germany serves as illustrative case, where auctions (a form of quantity control) succeeded feed-in tariffs (a price instrument). \n",
            " - conceptualizing market formation for transformative policy. transitions are hardly conceivable without understanding how new markets are formed. however, there is still an incipient conceptualization of market formation in the context of transformation and transformative policy. drawing on existing perspectives of market formation in economics of innovation, sociology of markets and marketing studies literature, this paper develops a framework for characterizing, differentiating and analyzing new market formation processes. we use three case studies to demonstrate how the framework is able to capture the dynamic and interconnected nature of market formation. the market formation framework serves to diagnose potential misalignments, bottlenecks and failures, to identify entry points for policy to intervene in market formation and support transformative innovation. \n",
            " - understanding the limits to forming policy-driven markets in the electricity sector. the formation of policy-pushed markets has been underexamined in the transition literature, despite their importance for achieving sustainability policy objectives and their greater risk of failure. this study draws from service-dominant logic, i.e., a marketing-originated meta-theory of markets, to explain why one of these policy-pushed markets—local energy flexibility markets—may not develop. in particular, we show that to decide whether to participate in these policy-pushed markets, market actors assess the resources available to them, anticipate the required interactions to integrate resources, and forecast potential value formation. actors’ limited ability to identify or access resources, and/or their unwillingness or inability to interact with other actors to integrate resources explain why value processes do not unfold so that the market does not develop. we also demonstrate that existing institutional arrangements may limit actors’ agency to access to resources or coordinate value flows, which prevents the policy-pushed market from self-adjustment. \n",
            " - shaping sustainable markets—a conceptual framework illustrated by the case of biogas in sweden. by merging findings from transition studies with recent literature on market-shaping, this paper outlines a conceptual framework that describes the shaping of sustainable markets. the framework comprises three critical processes: enabling exchange practices, proving the system and constructing the narrative. individually, these processes generate different kinds of value – traded, demonstrated and expected value – and the value output from each process serves as input to the other two processes. hence the value streams link the processes together. we illustrate the framework by analyzing market-shaping processes for biogas in sweden. the case analysis shows how public and private actors have engaged in a multitude of activities that have built up the market-shaping processes. the analysis highlights the recursive nature of sustainable market-shaping, showing how key actors must repeatedly respond to tensions resulting from growth and aspirations of growth. \n",
            " - market formation in the context of transitions: a comment on the transitions agenda. transition studies has recently underscored the need to focus on upscaling and diffusion of innovations. a key question is how these innovations, already existing in niche markets, can become diffused and embedded in broader markets. as a first step, we offer ideas about the design and formation of what one might call ‘markets for transitions’. we argue that less attention has been paid to legitimized perceptions of market boundaries, the roles of actors, the interplay between markets, and the process character of market formation. \n",
            " - markets as leverage points for transformations of economic systems: the example of the german bioeconomy. this paper discusses a method for the identification of leverage points for the transformation of complex economic systems by combining value chain analysis and a relational perspective on markets. we introduce the network of markets approach and show that it is central in bridging the two concepts and apply social network analysis in order to do so. the case of the german bioeconomy, the transition from a fossil to a bio-based economy, is chosen to exemplify the application of the method. here, we provide the specific rationales behind our approach and identify possible key markets for governance interventions in the transformation toward a bio-based economy in germany. \n",
            " - sustainable market transformation: a refined framework for analyzing causal loops in transitions to sustainability. this article proposes a refined conceptual framework to understand and act upon sustainable market transformation processes. currently, there is a knowledge gap between government-oriented approaches to transition management and market formation that is addressed in evolutionary economics. consequently, this article builds upon literature in the field of evolutionary economics, systems theory and transition management, to conceptualize the causal loops which trigger collective behavior facing sustainability issues. furthermore, it proposes how these causal loops can be altered by interventions of actors in four sequential transition phases and illustrates what kind of interventions are most effective to accelerate a sustainable market transformation process. promising avenues for future empirical studies based on the suggested conceptual framework, are the investigation of how the concepts of sustainable market transformation are applied in different market contexts and the evaluation of whether the applied interventions actually alter the underlying causal loops. \n",
            " - introducing the lens of markets-in-the-making to transition studies: the case of the danish wind power market agencement. this paper contributes to a renewed understanding of markets in transition studies by focusing on how unknown things must be ‘framed’ and pacified in order to be attributed some ‘value’ that makes them ‘matter’. we empirically analyze the making of a market agencement for wind power deployment in denmark. using an analytical framework of framing and pacifying, we trace three entangled ‘domains of action’ associated with the employment of (a) sociopolitical devices to enable the discursive valuation of wind power, (b) economic devices to develop price-setting models for investors, and (c) technical devices to facilitate grid integration, thereby framing wind power as socio-politically, economically, and techno-scientifically ‘valuable’, respectively. this market agencement has consistently produced concerns (i.e., overflows) requiring constant re-framing. we discuss how the lens of markets-in-the-making can contribute to transition studies. by showing how the domains of action entangle and ‘overflow’ onto each other, this study demonstrates that the relational lens of socio-technical agencements can help shed additional light on the dynamics and agency of markets in transition. \n",
            " - the role of governments in uncertainty orchestration in market formation for sustainability transitions. market formation in sustainability transitions is characterised by deep and longstanding uncertainty. albeit prior research provides a rich repertoire of theoretical frameworks on how incumbent firms and entrepreneurs deal with uncertainty, there is still scant literature on the role of the government in orchestrating uncertainty concerning market formation. by studying multiple cases involving an innovation agency and municipalities in brazil, we propose a new framework composed of a distinguishing typology of uncertainties and patterns of actions regarding how the government can orchestrate the mitigation of these uncertainties in market formation in sustainability transitions. government actors cope with configurational uncertainty through boundary experimentation, affiliation uncertainty by removing barriers, and interdependence uncertainty by setting long-term mechanisms (nurturing, facilitating and driving interdependence). our framework suggests that government actors adopt strategies to increase their legitimacy in driving market formation under uncertainty and use epistemic regulation to mitigate hypes. implications and opportunities for further research are also discussed. \n",
            " - introduction to ‘markets in sustainability transitions’. if sustainability transitions research is to be relevant for upscaled diffusion of radical innovations and wide systemic socio-technical changes, then markets remain critical to account for. founding frameworks in transition studies regard markets and market formation as important. yet, the conceptualization of markets has so far not been elaborate: markets are mostly pictured as target areas for sustainable innovation and emphasis is on diffusion and user involvement. this special issue aims to unpack the notion of markets and market formation in sustainability transitions. the special issue contains in total 13 papers, which draw on theory from various scientific disciplines, use diverse research approaches, and cover a multitude of contexts. altogether, the collection of papers stimulates broader theorizing of markets in sustainability transitions and the formulation of an agenda for future studies on markets in sustainability transitions. this editorial paper proposes relevant topics for such a research agenda. \n",
