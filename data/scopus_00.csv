To illustrate, assess and map research at the intersection of AI and innovation, we performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of published work indexed in the Clarivate Web of Science (WOS) and Elsevier Scopus databases (the final sample includes 1448 articles). A bibliometric analysis was deployed to map the focal field in terms of dominant topics and their evolution over time. By deploying keyword co-occurrences, and bibliographic coupling techniques, we generate insights on the literature at the intersection of AI and innovation research. We leverage the SLR findings to provide an updated synopsis of extant scientific work on the focal research area and to develop an interpretive framework which sheds light on the drivers and outcomes of AI adoption for innovation. We identify economic, technological, and social factors of AI adoption in firms willing to innovate. We also uncover firms' economic, competitive and organizational, and innovation factors as key outcomes of AI deployment. We conclude this paper by developing an agenda for future research. © 2022 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Bibliometric analysis; Innovation; Systematic literature review","Bibliometrics analysis; Conceptual frameworks; Elsevier; Future research directions; Innovation; Innovation research; Scholarly works; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Web of Science; Artificial intelligence",,,,,,"We are grateful to the Editors and the anonymous reviewers for their constructive guidance.","Abella, A., Ortiz-De-Urbina-Criado, M., De-Pablos-Heredero, C., A model for the analysis of data-driven innovation and value generation in smart cities' ecosystems (2017) Cities, 64, pp. 47-53; Akter, S., Motamarri, S., Hani, U., Shams, R., Fernando, M., Babu, M.M., Shen, K.N., Building dynamic service analytics capabilities for the digital marketplace (2020) J.

By adopting a Systematic Quantitative Literature Review (SQLR) approach, we retrieved articles published in academic journals, and analysed them using bibliometric techniques such as keyword co-occurrences and bibliographic coupling. The findings allow us to offer an up-to-date outline of existing literature that are embedded into an interpretative framework allowing to disentangle the key antecedents and consequences of AI in the context of innovation. Among the antecedents, we identify technological, social, and economic reasons leading firms to embrace AI to innovate. In addition to detecting the disciplinary foci, we also identify firms' product innovation, process innovation, business model innovation and social innovation, as key consequences of AI deployment. Drawing on the key findings from this study, we offer research directions for further investigation in relation to different types of innovation. © 2022 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Bibliometric techniques; Systematic quantitative literature review; Types of innovation",,,,,,,,"Acar, M., Toker, A., Predicting consumer personality traits in the sharing economy: The case of airbnb (2019) Applied Marketing Analytics, 5 (1), pp. 83-96; Agostini, L., Galati, F., Gastaldi, L., The digitalization of the innovation process (2019) European Journal of Innovation Management, 23 (1), pp. 1-12; Akter, S., Wamba, S.F., Mariani, M., Hani, U., How to Build an Ai climate-driven service analytics capability for innovation and performance in industrial markets?“ (2021) Industrial Marketing Management, 97, pp. 258-273; Alidrisi, H., Measuring the environmental maturity of the supply chain finance: A big data-based multi-criteria perspective (2021) Logistics, 5 (2), pp. 22-24; Alshawaaf, N., Lee, S.H., Business model innovation through digitisation in social purpose organisations: A comparative analysis of tate modern and pompidou centre (2021) Journal of Business Research, 125, pp. 597-608; Anshari, M., Almunawar, M.N., Masri, M., Financial technology and disruptive innovation in business (2020) International Journal of Asian Business and Information Management, 11 (4), pp. 29-43; Anton, E., Osterreich, T.D., JulianSchuir, L.P., Teuteberg, F., A business model taxonomy for start-ups in the electric power industry – The electrifying effect of Artificial Intelligence on business model innovation (2021) International Journal od Innovation and Technology Management, 18 (3); Antons, D., Breidbach, C.F., Big data, big insights?

A great deal of attention has been paid to the effects associated with the adoption of such transformative technologies, whilst the impact associated with their production, and in particular with the development of related technological knowledge, has remained almost unexplored. Using patent data at country level for a sample of industrialized economies between 1990 and 2014, this paper seeks to quantify the productivity spillovers associated with intelligent technologies. We show that the elasticity of aggregate productivity to the stock of knowledge related to intelligent technologies is statistically significant and economically important, ranging between 0.01 and 0.06. Since these innovations have increased by a factor of 3 from the early 1990s, based on our most conservative estimates, knowledge related to intelligent technologies would account for a range between 3 and 8% of observed productivity change. We also document that the time pattern of productivity spillovers associated with intelligent technology patents may conform to a productivity J-curve, corroborating the view that such innovations could behave as General Purpose Technologies (GPTs). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","General purpose technologies; Intelligent technologies; Productivity spillovers",,,,,,,"The author wishes to thank the Editor Scott Adams, and Ioana Igna, Antonio Minniti, Klaus Prettner for helpful comments.","Abeliansky, A., Prettner, K., Automation and Demographic Change (2017) Working Paper 05-2017, , University of Hohenheim, Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Science; Acemoglu, D., Lelarge, C., Restrepo, P., Competing with robots: firm-level evidence from France (2020) AEA Pap.
