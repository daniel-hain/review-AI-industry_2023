AI in influencer marketing, e-health and wellbeing monitoring using smart healthcare devices, and the role of human–machine interactive devices for post-COVID-19 innovative sustainable tourism in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam']","['e-health and wellbeing monitoring using smart healthcare devices: an empirical investigation. according to the united nations sustainable development goal no. 3 (sdg – goal 3), for sustainable development it is imperative to ensure health and well-being across all ages, and is achievable only through effective and continuous healthcare monitoring. but in india and other third world countries, healthcare monitoring is poor compared to other countries in the world, in spite of it being affordable. the global healthcare smart wearable healthcare (swh) devices market is expected to rise up at a cagr (compound annual growth rate) of 5.6% and by 2020 it is expected to reach 25 billion (gvr report, 2016). the growing incidences of lifestyle diseases, sedentary lifestyle, busy work schedules, technological advancements in healthcare monitoring devices, and increased usage of remote devicesseems to be some of the important factors fuelling this growth. some of the major players in this segment are abbott laboratories, philips healthcare, life watch, ge healthcare, omron healthcare, siemens healthcare and honeywell international inc. etc. but in spite of the healthcare monitoring devices are being predicted to be technologically innovative and providing advanced as well as basic health care monitoring features and available in various price ranges based on the features, we wanted to empirically study the attitude towards adoption of such devices in india. india has traditionally been having a very lackadaisical attitude towards healthcare monitoring. in such a context, what would be the factors influencing the adoption of swh devices. remote health monitoring can enhance the nature of wellbeing administration and to lessen the aggregate expense in human services by maintaining a strategic distance from pointless hospitalizations and guaranteeing that the individuals who need critical consideration get it sooner. this empirical investigation would provide a detailed insight as to how these wearable internet of things devices would bring about a revolution in the healthcare industry. it would also provide the future prospect of iot devices in this sector and how the probability of increase in its usage can be increased with time. the paper explores intrusiveness (intr), comfort (c), perceived usefulness (pu) and perceived ease of use (eou) of swh devices. the study hypothesized the impact of pu and eou, intr and c on attitude and intention to use towards adoption of swh devices. partial least square structured equation modeling (pls – sem) methodology was applied to explore the relationships between the concepts and hypothesis. the data was collected from 273 respondents. the age group of the respondents was between 25 and 40 years. the results indicated that intrusiveness and comfort do not have a significant direct impact on intention to use bi (behavior intention) bi swh devices. at the same time intrusiveness had a significant impact on pu of swh devices and comfort has a strong significant impact on pu and eou of smart wearables. the research has strong implications in the current emerging context of smart wearables, their design and effectiveness. also the research can have lasting implications on elderly health and well-being. there are very few empirical studies in the area of swh devices. most of the studies till now are conceptual studies or providing technology architectures and frameworks. the research in this area is still at a very nascent stage and very few studies have been done to explore the use and adoption of swh devices.', 'unreal influence: leveraging ai in influencer marketing. purpose: this paper aims to examine how consumers respond to social media influencers that are created through artificial intelligence (ai) and compares effects to traditional (human) influencers. design/methodology/approach: across two empirical studies, the authors examine the efficacy of ai social media influencers. with study 1, the authors establish baseline effects for ai influencers and investigate how social-psychological distance impacts consumer perceptions. the authors also investigate the role of an influencer’s agency – being autonomous or externally managed – to test the boundaries of the results and determine the interactive effects between influencer type and influencer agency. study 2 acts as an extension and validation of study 1, whereby the authors provide generalisability and overlay the role of need for uniqueness as a moderated mediator. findings: the authors show that there are similarities and differences in the ways in which consumers view ai and human influencers. importantly, the authors find no difference in terms of intention to follow or personalisation. this suggests that consumers are equally open to follow an ai or human influencer, and they perceive the level of personalisation provided by either influencer type as similar. furthermore, while an ai influencer is generally perceived as having lower source trust, they are more likely to evoke word-of-mouth intentions. in understanding these effects, the authors show that social distance mediates the relationship between influencer type and the outcomes the authors investigate. results also show that ai influencers can have a greater effect on consumers who have a high need for uniqueness. finally, the authors find that a lack of influencer agency has a detrimental effect. research limitations/implications: the studies investigate consumers’ general response to ai influencers within the context of instagram, however, future research might examine consumers’ response to posts promoting specific products across a variety of category contexts and within different social media platforms. practical implications: the authors find that in some ways, an ai influencer can be as effective as a human influencer. indeed, the authors suggest that there may be a spill-over effect from consumer experiences with other ai recommendation systems, meaning that consumers are open to ai influencer recommendations. however, the authors find consistent evidence that ai influencers are trusted less than traditional influencers, hence the authors caution brands from rushing to replace human influencers with their ai counterparts. originality/value: this paper offers novel insight into the increasingly prominent phenomenon of the ai influencer. specifically, it takes initial steps towards developing understanding as to how consumers respond to ai influencers and contrast these effects with human influencers.', 'factors influencing adoption of payments banks by indian customers: extending utaut with perceived credibility. purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors influencing the behavioral intention to adopt payments banks services by indian underbanked and unbanked population. design/methodology/approach: the proposed model has assimilated factors from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) along with perceived credibility. the factors of utaut include performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitation of conditions and social influence. apart from testing the direct relationships of the model constructs with the behavioral intention to adopt payments banks services, the study has also explored mediating and moderating effects of certain constructs. the research model has been empirically tested using 660 responses from a field survey conducted in new delhi – the capital city of india – by using the structured equation modeling (sem) technique. the target respondents of the study are small businessmen and migrant laborers who are either underbanked or unbanked. findings: the findings of the study reveal that the model is able to explain 67.5 per cent of the variance in behavioral intention. the results indicate that all the factors are direct determinants of behavioral intention. perceived credibility is found to be the strongest influencer of behavioral intention. the findings also indicate that perceived credibility partially mediates the relationships between “social influence and behavioral intention” and “performance expectancy and behavioral intention.” the relationship between performance expectancy and behavioral intention is also found to be moderated by facilitating conditions and effort expectancy. research limitations/implications: as this study is based on a convenience sample of respondents of only one city of india, this could negatively reflect on the generalizability of results across other cities. moreover, the study has only focused on the perceptions of small businessmen and migrant laborers. this raises concerns regarding the applicability of the results for other segments of the current population that have different demographic characteristics (e.g. occupation, income, education level and technology experience). modifying the conceptual model presented in this research to include “experience” and “age” as moderators can also be worth considering in future. although this study has extended the utaut to include perceived credibility, the results of the explanatory power of the model indicate that there is still room for improvement. therefore, including other constructs, e.g. hedonic motivation, perceived risks and trialability, could be a fruitful path forward. future studies may also examine the factors influencing the actual use behavior of payments banks, rather than just behavioral intention. practical implications: the study looks forward to providing the payments banks service providers in india with suitable guidelines for effectively implementing and designing payments banks services. specifically, the results of this study have provided clues for indian payments banks service providers about the crucial role of perceived credibility in influencing the behavioral intention to adopt payments banks. therefore, service providers have to initially be sure that payments banks are able to conduct financial transactions efficiently, securely and within less time, along with the availability of information required by customers to successfully use the services. service providers should enhance customer confidence and trust by providing secure and reliable services. they should also emphasize on the positive safety measures of the payments banks during any marketing campaign rather than just creating brand awareness. originality/value: the study represents a substantial contribution to the existing knowledge regarding mobile payment channels in particular and technology acceptance area in general. in fact, this study presents a worthwhile direction by examining payments banks services, which, so far, have not been well evaluated in the indian context. to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is an early attempt toward a holistic and integrative approach to explain adoption of payments banks in india. although prior studies have addressed mobile banking and mobile payment adoption, the strength of this research lies in combining the utaut constructs with perceived credibility. this is evidenced by the high explanatory power (67.5 per cent) of the research model adopted in this study.']"

innovation in b2b marketing. purpose of the paper: the paper explores use of big data in innovation and market leadership in b2b relationships. it provides a framework to analyze the impact of big data, supported by four case studies. methodology/approach: this is a conceptual paper, supported by case studies, offering the opportunity for concept generalization. the case study organizations are innovating to stay ahead in the market and to expand activity, using big data to exploit marketing opportunities and create new offerings. findings: organizations are recipients of and are collectors of big data, partly created by the increasing volume of business and customer transactions online. the qualitative exploration of the cases shows that big data and its analytics and applications can be taken as indicators of organizations’ ability to innovate to respond to market opportunities. research limitations/implications: the online marketing environment is a dynamic one, where organizations must innovate to survive. a limitation is that the cases in the paper do not deal with those lagging in innovation, for whom survival is an issue. the paper’s examples are limited to successful organizations where big data, data mining and analytics led to strategic business success. practical implications: b2b organizations that operate in markets where their own products or services have a significant impact on how the products and services of their b2b customers provide value to end (b2c) customers should, in their innovation activity, engage fully with the end b2c market, together with their b2b customers. this has implications in every area from strategy to human resources. if the b2b organization’s pedigree includes b2c activity parallel to that of their customers but not competitive, this can give them an advantage in marketing, but if their b2c activities start to encroach on the b2c activities of their customers, this may cause conflict and loss of business. this implies that if marketing strategy becomes siloed between the different branches of the business, the potential for conflict increases. originality/value of the paper: the paper’s value is in contributing to understanding big data’s role in business innovation, specifically in business to business organizations and where their innovation can transform customer experience at the end of the value chain, i.e., with final consumers. therefore, the paper helps to address a research gap in the literature, which tends to focus on how such innovation affects business-to-business relationships.', 'the impact of big data analytics on firms’ high value business performance. big data analytics (bda) is an emerging phenomenon with the reported potential to transform how firms manage and enhance high value businesses performance. the purpose of our study is to investigate the impact of bda on operations management in the manufacturing sector, which is an acknowledged infrequently researched context. using an interpretive qualitative approach, this empirical study leverages a comparative case study of three manufacturing companies with varying levels of bda usage (experimental, moderate and heavy). the information technology (it) business value literature and a resource based view informed the development of our research propositions and the conceptual framework that illuminated the relationships between bda capability and organizational readiness and design. our findings indicate that bda capability (in terms of data sourcing, access, integration, and delivery, analytical capabilities, and people’s expertise) along with organizational readiness and design factors (such as bda strategy, top management support, financial resources, and employee engagement) facilitated better utilization of bda in manufacturing decision making, and thus enhanced high value business performance. our results also highlight important managerial implications related to the impact of bda on empowerment of employees, and how bda can be integrated into organizations to augment rather than replace management capabilities. our research will be of benefit to academics and practitioners in further aiding our understanding of bda utilization in transforming operations and production management. it adds to the body of limited empirically based knowledge by highlighting the real business value resulting from applying bda in manufacturing firms and thus encouraging beneficial economic societal changes.', 'digital transformation challenges: strategies emerging from a multi-stakeholder approach. purpose: this paper proposes adequate strategies that companies, public administrators and organisations in the education industry can undertake to successfully face the challenges of digital transformation in a regional innovation system. this research considers stakeholders that operate in the tyrol–veneto macroregion (the tyrol, south tyrol and veneto areas), a significant case of moderately innovative european macroregion. design/methodology/approach: this study undertakes explorative research based on a qualitative method. it adopts a place-based multi-stakeholder approach to emphasise the role of three categories of stakeholders (companies, educational system and regional governments) in facing digital changes. more precisely, interviews with 60 stakeholders from the tyrol–veneto macroregion were conducted and examined via both text mining analysis and content analysis. first, correspondence factor analysis was performed using iramuteq software to identify homogeneous subsets of concepts (pillars–i.e., macroareas of strategic actions). second, two coding phases were implemented using nvivo software to detect strategic fields of action and specific strategic actions undertaken to address the challenges of digital transformation. findings: the results highlight that digital transformation is a pervasive challenge of regional innovative system that requires a multifaceted set of strategic actions falling into three main pillars. the first pillar, named “culture and skills”, includes three strategic fields of action as follows: digital education, talents and digital culture. the second pillar, named “infrastructures and technologies”, points out the need of information, interaction and artificial intelligence as key strategic fields of action. the third pillar, named “ecosystems”, highlights the importance of investing in medium- to long-term visions, partnerships and life quality. in brief, this study shows that standalone interventions are insufficient to tackle digital transformation from a systemic perspective. moreover, this study outlines the potential contribution of each category of stakeholder to foster the digitalisation of the tyrol–veneto macroregion. practical implications: this study highlights the importance of developing digital culture and skills before investing in digital infrastructure and technology in a moderately innovative macroregion. companies should alter their vision before reconfiguring their business models, invest in smart working and establish contacts with start-ups. in addition, this study recommends that public administration should mainly invest in digital education and partnerships, while, in terms of education and training organisations, it suggests providing digital skills to several cohorts of both students and workers. policy implications call for the creation of new occasions of cooperation among stakeholders by fostering “table talks” as strategic and policy actions and by making more financial resources available to encourage the digital transformation processes. originality/value: the results of this study may be adapted to the characteristics of other regional innovative systems and used as a reference point in terms of the improvement of business, market and local development.']"

positive and negative employee experiences due to artificial intelligence (ai) adoption and the creation of technostress. it unravels the human resource development-related challenges with the onset of industry 4.0. design/methodology/approach: semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 professionals with average work experience of 7.6 years and working across nine industries, and the transcripts were analyzed using nvivo. findings: the findings establish prominent adverse impacts of the adoption of ai, namely, information security, data privacy, drastic changes resulting from digital transformations and job risk and insecurity brewing in the employee psyche. this is followed by a hierarchy of factors comprising the positive impacts, namely, work-related flexibility and autonomy, creativity and innovation and overall enhancement in job performance. further factors contributing to technostress (among employees): work overload, job insecurity and complexity were identified. practical implications: the emerging knowledge economy and technological interventions are changing the existing job profiles, hence the need for different skillsets and technological competencies. the organizations thus need to deploy strategic manpower development measures involving up-gradation of skills and knowledge management. inculcating requisite skills requires well-designed training programs using specialized tools and virtual reality (vr). in addition, employees need to be supported in their evolving socio-technical relationships, for managing both positive and negative outcomes. originality/value: this research makes the unique contribution of establishing a qualitative hierarchy of prominent factors constituting unintended consequences,

ai-based transformation projects. purpose: the main purpose of our study is to analyze the influence of artificial intelligence (ai) on firm performance, notably by building on the business value of ai-based transformation projects. this study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of ai and ai concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of ai-based solution providers; and (4) a review of ai literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of ai-enabled projects transformation within organizations. design/methodology/approach: this study has called on the theory of it capabilities to seize the influence of ai business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). the research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from ibm, aws, cloudera, nvidia, conversica, universal robots websites, etc. studying the influence of ai on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations’ ai-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase. findings: ai covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. organizations have been adopting ai technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. ai fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. thus, the results of our study have highlighted such ai benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. by building on these ai attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. the same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through ai capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes. research limitations/implications: ai obviously influences the way businesses are done today. therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider ai as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. for the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of ai within organizations. in terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of ai on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. as for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of ai, and therefore improve organizations’ performance, the profitability of their investments in ai transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. this study also allows managers to consider ai not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of it in the various company’s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of ai: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. originality/value: this article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from ai deployment reports in organizations. the transformation of projects based on the use of ai focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of ai-based projects and the impact of ai on firm performance. more specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of ai at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of it in various industries.', 'on the current state of combining human and artificial intelligence for strategic organizational decision making. strategic organizational decision making in today’s complex world is a dynamic process characterized by uncertainty. therefore, diverse groups of responsible employees deal with the large amount and variety of information, which must be acquired and interpreted correctly to deduce adequate alternatives. the technological potential of artificial intelligence (ai) is expected to offer further support, although research in this regard is still developing. however, as the technology is designed to have capabilities beyond those of traditional machines, the effects on the division of tasks and the definition of roles established in the current human–machine relationship are discussed with increasing awareness. based on a systematic literature review, combined with content analysis, this article provides an overview of the possibilities that current research identifies for integrating ai into organizational decision making under uncertainty. the findings are summarized in a conceptual model that first explains how humans can use ai for decision making under uncertainty and then identifies the challenges, pre-conditions, and consequences that must be considered. while research on organizational structures, the choice of ai application, and the possibilities of knowledge management is extensive, a clear recommendation for ethical frameworks, despite being defined as a crucial foundation, is missing. in addition, ai, other than traditional machines, can amplify problems inherent in the decision-making process rather than help to reduce them. as a result, the human responsibility increases, while the capabilities needed to use the technology differ from other machines, thus making education necessary. these findings make the study valuable for both researchers and practitioners.']"

however, there is no research that clearly conceptualizes industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain. this paper aims to propose the term “supply chain 4.0” together with a novel conceptual framework that captures the essence of industry 4.0 within the supply chain context. as industry 4.0 is inherently a revolution, and as revolutions are evolutionary, this research also aims to capture the evolution of supply chain 4.0 from maturity levels perspective to facilitate the formulation and development of supply chain 4.0 strategy. design/methodology/approach: following a deductive research approach and a qualitative strategy, a systematic literature review (slr) was adopted as the research method seeking to understand the relationships among supply chain, industry 4.0 and maturity levels research. the three phases of the slr process utilized are: planning, conducting and reporting. a concept-oriented technique was applied to the outputs of the slr to obtain the key constructs that would facilitate the development of the conceptual supply chain 4.0 framework. findings: the slr showed that there is limited research linking industry 4.0 to supply chain. nevertheless, it was possible to extract a set of thematic categories from the analysis of the articles which are referred to as constructs as they form the core of the conceptual supply chain 4.0 framework. these constructs are managerial and capability supporters, technology levers, processes performance requirements and strategic outcomes. each of these constructs consists of a number of elements which are referred to as “dimensions” in this research and a total of 21 dimensions were identified during the slr. the slr also demonstrated that maturity propositions for industry 4.0 are still embrionary and entirely missing in the context of supply chain. hence, this research develops and proposes a maturity levels framework that is underpinned by the core constructs of supply chain 4.0 and the corresponding dimensions. as these proposed frameworks are conceptual, this research also identifies and proposes several research directions to help fortify the supply chain 4.0 concept. research limitations/implications: this research argues that the frameworks are robust because the constructs and dimensions are grounded in the literature, thus demonstrating both theoretical and practical relevance and value. as supply chain 4.0 research is still in infancy, there is a range of open research questions suggested based on the frameworks that could serve as guides for researchers to further develop the supply chain 4.0 concept. also, practitioners can use this framework to develop better understanding of supply chain 4.0 and be able to evaluate the maturity of their organizations. as the proposed frameworks are conceptual, they require further empirical research to validate them and obtain new insights. originality/value: the slr demonstrated a clear gap in literature with regards to industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain, and also in the context of industry 4.0 maturity levels for supply chain. this research is unique as it formulates and introduces novel frameworks that close these gaps in literature. the value of this research lies in the fact that it makes significant contribution in terms of understanding of supply chain 4.0 with a clear set of constructs and dimensions that form supply chain 4.0, which provides the foundation for further work in this area.']"

yet context-rooted design principles for humanoid robot adoption in hospitality service encounters. design/methodology/approach: adopting a multiple method qualitative approach, two service prototypes are evaluated with hospitality and tourism experts (n = 30, prototype 1) and frontline hospitality employees (n = 18, prototype 2) using participant observation, in situ feedback, semi-structured interviews and photo-elicitation. findings: the adoption of humanoid service robots in hospitality is influenced by the following four layers of determinants: contextual, social, interactional and psychological factors, as well as extrinsic and intrinsic drivers of adoption. these empirical findings both confirm and extend previous conceptualizations of human-robot interaction (hri) in hospitality service. research limitations/implications: despite using photo-elicitation to evoke insight regarding the use of different types of service robots in hospitality, the paper mostly focuses on anthropomorphized service robots such as pepper™. practical implications: adopting humanoid service robots will transform hospitality operations, whereby the most routine, unpleasant tasks such as taking repeat orders or dealing with complaints may be delegated to service robots or human-robot teams. social implications: working with and receiving service from pepper™ changes the service encounter from direct practical, technical considerations to more nuanced social and psychological implications, particularly around feelings of self-esteem, social pressure and social judgment. originality/value: this paper presents one of the first empirical studies on hri in hospitality service encounters using softbank robotics’ pepper™. in doing so, the paper presents a novel framework

robots and covid-19: exploring perceptions of prevention efficacy at hotels in generation z. purpose: covid-19 is expected to enhance hospitality robotization because frontline robots facilitate social distancing, lowering contagion risk. investing in frontline robots emerges as a solution to recover customer trust and encourage demand. however, we ignore how customers perceive these initiatives and, therefore, their efficacy. focusing on robot employment at hotels and on generation z customers, this study aims to analyze guests’ perceptions about robots’ covid-19 prevention efficacy and their impact on booking intentions. design/methodology/approach: this study tests its hypotheses combining an experimental design methodology with partial least squares. survey data from 711 generation z individuals in spain were collected in 2 periods of time. findings: generation z customers consider that robots reduce contagion risk at hotels. robot anthropomorphism increases perceived covid-19 prevention efficacy, regardless of the context where the robots are used. robots’ covid-19 prevention efficacy provokes better attitudes and higher booking intentions. research limitations/implications: the sampling method used in this research impedes this study’s results generalization. further research could replicate this study using random sampling methods to ensure representativeness, even for other generational cohorts. practical implications: employing robots as a covid-19 prevention measure can enhance demand, especially if robots are human-like. hoteliers need to communicate that robots can reduce contagion risk, particularly in markets more affected by covid-19. robots must be employed in low social presence contexts. governments could encourage robotization by financially supporting hotels and publicly acknowledging its benefits regarding covid-19 prevention. originality/value: this study combines preventive health, robotics and hospitality

hospitality and tourism industries introduce service robots to reduce their operational costs and to provide customers with enhanced services (e.g. greater convenience). in turn, customers may consider that such a disruptive innovation is altering the established conditions of the service-provider relationship. based on attribution theory, this research explores how customers’ attributions about the firm motivations to implement service robots (i.e. cost reduction and service enhancement) are affecting customers’ intentions to use and recommend this innovation. following previous research on robot’s acceptance, our research framework analyzes how these attributions may be shaped by customers’ perceptions of robot’s human-likeness and their affinity with the robot. structural equation modelling is used to analyze data collected from 517 customers evaluating service robots in the hospitality industry; results show that attributions mediate the relationships between affinity toward the robot and customer behavioral intentions to use and recommend service robots. specifically, customer’s affinity toward the service robot positively affects service improvement attribution, which in turn has a positive influence on customer behavioral intentions. in contrast, affinity negatively affects cost reduction attribution, which in turn has a negative effect on behavioral intentions. finally, human-likeness has a positive influence on affinity. this research provides practitioners with empirical evidence and guidance about the introduction of service robots and its relational implications in hospitality and tourism industries. theoretical advances and future research avenues are also discussed.']"
