consequences for work and place. the relationship between technology and work, and concerns about the displacement effects of technology and the organisation of work, have a long history. the last decade has seen the proliferation of academic papers, consultancy reports and news articles about the possible effects of artificial intelligence (ai) on work-creating visions of both utopian and dystopian workplace futures. ai has the potential to transform the demand for labour, the nature of work and operational infrastructure by solving complex problems with high efficiency and speed. however, despite hundreds of reports and studies, ai remains an enigma, a newly emerging technology, and its rate of adoption and implications for the structure of work are still only beginning to be understood. the current anxiety about labour displacement anticipates the growth and direct use of ai. yet, in many ways, at present ai is likely being overestimated in terms of impact. still, an increasing body of research argues the consequences for work will be highly uneven and depend on a range of factors, including place, economic activity, business culture, education levels and gender, among others. we appraise the history and the blurry boundaries around the definitions of ai. we explore the debates around the extent of job augmentation, substitution, destruction and displacement by examining the empirical basis of claims, rather than mere projections. explorations of corporate reactions to the prospects of ai penetration, and the role of consultancies in prodding firms to embrace the technology, represent another perspective onto our inquiry. we conclude by exploring the impacts of ai changes in the quantity and quality of labour on a range of social, geographic and governmental outcomes.', 'supply chain 4.0: concepts, maturity and research agenda. purpose: industry 4.0 is one of the most emergent research topics attracting significant interest by researchers as well as practitioners. many articles have been published with regards industry 4.0; however, there is no research that clearly conceptualizes industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain. this paper aims to propose the term “supply chain 4.0” together with a novel conceptual framework that captures the essence of industry 4.0 within the supply chain context. as industry 4.0 is inherently a revolution, and as revolutions are evolutionary, this research also aims to capture the evolution of supply chain 4.0 from maturity levels perspective to facilitate the formulation and development of supply chain 4.0 strategy. design/methodology/approach: following a deductive research approach and a qualitative strategy, a systematic literature review (slr) was adopted as the research method seeking to understand the relationships among supply chain, industry 4.0 and maturity levels research. the three phases of the slr process utilized are: planning, conducting and reporting. a concept-oriented technique was applied to the outputs of the slr to obtain the key constructs that would facilitate the development of the conceptual supply chain 4.0 framework. findings: the slr showed that there is limited research linking industry 4.0 to supply chain. nevertheless, it was possible to extract a set of thematic categories from the analysis of the articles which are referred to as constructs as they form the core of the conceptual supply chain 4.0 framework. these constructs are managerial and capability supporters, technology levers, processes performance requirements and strategic outcomes. each of these constructs consists of a number of elements which are referred to as “dimensions” in this research and a total of 21 dimensions were identified during the slr. the slr also demonstrated that maturity propositions for industry 4.0 are still embrionary and entirely missing in the context of supply chain. hence, this research develops and proposes a maturity levels framework that is underpinned by the core constructs of supply chain 4.0 and the corresponding dimensions. as these proposed frameworks are conceptual, this research also identifies and proposes several research directions to help fortify the supply chain 4.0 concept. research limitations/implications: this research argues that the frameworks are robust because the constructs and dimensions are grounded in the literature, thus demonstrating both theoretical and practical relevance and value. as supply chain 4.0 research is still in infancy, there is a range of open research questions suggested based on the frameworks that could serve as guides for researchers to further develop the supply chain 4.0 concept. also, practitioners can use this framework to develop better understanding of supply chain 4.0 and be able to evaluate the maturity of their organizations. as the proposed frameworks are conceptual, they require further empirical research to validate them and obtain new insights. originality/value: the slr demonstrated a clear gap in literature with regards to industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain, and also in the context of industry 4.0 maturity levels for supply chain. this research is unique as it formulates and introduces novel frameworks that close these gaps in literature. the value of this research lies in the fact that it makes significant contribution in terms of understanding of supply chain 4.0 with a clear set of constructs and dimensions that form supply chain 4.0, which provides the foundation for further work in this area.', ""artificial intelligence and business models in the sustainable development goals perspective: a systematic literature review. this paper investigates the literary corpus on the role of artificial intelligence (ai) in the construction of sustainable business models (sbms). it provides a quantitative overview of the academic literature that constitutes the field. the paper discusses the relationships between ai and rapid developments in machine learning and sustainable development (sd). specifically, the aim is to understand whether this branch of computer science can influence production and consumption patterns to achieve sustainable resource management according to sustainable development goals (sdgs) outlined in the un 2030 agenda. moreover, the paper aims to highlight the role of knowledge management systems (kms) in the cultural drift toward the spread of ai for sbms. despite the importance of the topic, there is no comprehensive review of the ai and sbm literature in light of sdgs. based on a database containing 73 publications in english with publication dates from 1990 to 2019, a bibliometric analysis is conducted. the findings show that the innovation challenge involves ethical, social, economic, and legal aspects. thus, considering that the development potential of ai is linked to the un 2030 agenda for sd, especially to sdg#12, our results also outline the framework of the existing literature on ai and sdgs, especially sdg#12, including ai's association with the cultural drift (cd) in the sbms. the paper highlights the key contributions, which are: i) a comprehensive review of the key underlying relationship between ai and sbms, offering a holistic view as needed, ii) identifying a research gap regarding kms through ai, and iii) the implications of ai concerning sdg#12. academic and managerial implications are also discussed regarding kms in the sbms, where the ai can represent the vehicle to meet the sdgs allowing for the identification of the cultural change required by enterprises to achieve sustainable goals. thus, business companies, academic research practitioners, and state policy should focus on the further development of the use of ai in sbms.""]"

customers knowledge from social media big data: toward an integrated methodological framework based on netnography and business analytics. purpose: this paper aims to demonstrate how the integration of netnography and business analytics can support companies in the process of value creation from social big data by leveraging on customer relationship management and customer knowledge management (ckm). design/methodology/approach: this paper adopts the methodology of a single case study by using desk analysis, netnography and business analytics. the context of analysis has been identified into the case of aurora company, a well-known producer of fountain pens. findings: the case demonstrates how the integration of big data analytics and netnography is relevant for the development of a customer relationship management strategy. the results obtained have been categorized according to the three main categories of customer knowledge, such as knowledge for, from and about customer. research limitations/implications: this paper presents implications for the advancement of the theory on ckm by demonstrating, as the acquisition, storage and management of data generated by customers on social media require the adoption of a cross-disciplinary approach resulting from the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches. the framework is structured as methodological tool to detect knowledge in virtual community. practical implications: practical implications arise for managers and entrepreneurs in terms of value creation from knowledge assets generated on social big data through the management of the customers’ relationship and data-driven innovation patterns. originality/value: this paper offers an original contribution of integration of well-established research streams. the focus on the knowledge under the perspectives of information assets for, from and about customers in the debate on value creation and management of big data is an element of value offered by this study in addition to the comprehension of strategies of social customer relationship management as actual initiative embraced by a company in the leveraging of innovation and tradition.', 'digital transformation challenges: strategies emerging from a multi-stakeholder approach. purpose: this paper proposes adequate strategies that companies, public administrators and organisations in the education industry can undertake to successfully face the challenges of digital transformation in a regional innovation system. this research considers stakeholders that operate in the tyrol–veneto macroregion (the tyrol, south tyrol and veneto areas), a significant case of moderately innovative european macroregion. design/methodology/approach: this study undertakes explorative research based on a qualitative method. it adopts a place-based multi-stakeholder approach to emphasise the role of three categories of stakeholders (companies, educational system and regional governments) in facing digital changes. more precisely, interviews with 60 stakeholders from the tyrol–veneto macroregion were conducted and examined via both text mining analysis and content analysis. first, correspondence factor analysis was performed using iramuteq software to identify homogeneous subsets of concepts (pillars–i.e., macroareas of strategic actions). second, two coding phases were implemented using nvivo software to detect strategic fields of action and specific strategic actions undertaken to address the challenges of digital transformation. findings: the results highlight that digital transformation is a pervasive challenge of regional innovative system that requires a multifaceted set of strategic actions falling into three main pillars. the first pillar, named “culture and skills”, includes three strategic fields of action as follows: digital education, talents and digital culture. the second pillar, named “infrastructures and technologies”, points out the need of information, interaction and artificial intelligence as key strategic fields of action. the third pillar, named “ecosystems”, highlights the importance of investing in medium- to long-term visions, partnerships and life quality. in brief, this study shows that standalone interventions are insufficient to tackle digital transformation from a systemic perspective. moreover, this study outlines the potential contribution of each category of stakeholder to foster the digitalisation of the tyrol–veneto macroregion. practical implications: this study highlights the importance of developing digital culture and skills before investing in digital infrastructure and technology in a moderately innovative macroregion. companies should alter their vision before reconfiguring their business models, invest in smart working and establish contacts with start-ups. in addition, this study recommends that public administration should mainly invest in digital education and partnerships, while, in terms of education and training organisations, it suggests providing digital skills to several cohorts of both students and workers. policy implications call for the creation of new occasions of cooperation among stakeholders by fostering “table talks” as strategic and policy actions and by making more financial resources available to encourage the digital transformation processes. originality/value: the results of this study may be adapted to the characteristics of other regional innovative systems and used as a reference point in terms of the improvement of business, market and local development.', 'the impact of big data analytics on firms’ high value business performance. big data analytics (bda) is an emerging phenomenon with the reported potential to transform how firms manage and enhance high value businesses performance. the purpose of our study is to investigate the impact of bda on operations management in the manufacturing sector, which is an acknowledged infrequently researched context. using an interpretive qualitative approach, this empirical study leverages a comparative case study of three manufacturing companies with varying levels of bda usage (experimental, moderate and heavy). the information technology (it) business value literature and a resource based view informed the development of our research propositions and the conceptual framework that illuminated the relationships between bda capability and organizational readiness and design. our findings indicate that bda capability (in terms of data sourcing, access, integration, and delivery, analytical capabilities, and people’s expertise) along with organizational readiness and design factors (such as bda strategy, top management support, financial resources, and employee engagement) facilitated better utilization of bda in manufacturing decision making, and thus enhanced high value business performance. our results also highlight important managerial implications related to the impact of bda on empowerment of employees, and how bda can be integrated into organizations to augment rather than replace management capabilities. our research will be of benefit to academics and practitioners in further aiding our understanding of bda utilization in transforming operations and production management. it adds to the body of limited empirically based knowledge by highlighting the real business value resulting from applying bda in manufacturing firms and thus encouraging beneficial economic societal changes.']"

employees working in industry 4.0 led organizations. purpose: this study attempts to develop a practical understanding of the positive and negative employee experiences due to artificial intelligence (ai) adoption and the creation of technostress. it unravels the human resource development-related challenges with the onset of industry 4.0. design/methodology/approach: semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 professionals with average work experience of 7.6 years and working across nine industries, and the transcripts were analyzed using nvivo. findings: the findings establish prominent adverse impacts of the adoption of ai, namely, information security, data privacy, drastic changes resulting from digital transformations and job risk and insecurity brewing in the employee psyche. this is followed by a hierarchy of factors comprising the positive impacts, namely, work-related flexibility and autonomy, creativity and innovation and overall enhancement in job performance. further factors contributing to technostress (among employees): work overload, job insecurity and complexity were identified. practical implications: the emerging knowledge economy and technological interventions are changing the existing job profiles, hence the need for different skillsets and technological competencies. the organizations thus need to deploy strategic manpower development measures involving up-gradation of skills and knowledge management. inculcating requisite skills requires well-designed training programs using specialized tools and virtual reality (vr). in addition, employees need to be supported in their evolving socio-technical relationships, for managing both positive and negative outcomes. originality/value: this research makes the unique contribution of establishing a qualitative hierarchy of prominent factors constituting unintended consequences, positive impacts and technostress creators (among employees) of ai deployment in organizational

influencing the behavioral intention to adopt payments banks services by indian underbanked and unbanked population. design/methodology/approach: the proposed model has assimilated factors from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) along with perceived credibility. the factors of utaut include performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitation of conditions and social influence. apart from testing the direct relationships of the model constructs with the behavioral intention to adopt payments banks services, the study has also explored mediating and moderating effects of certain constructs. the research model has been empirically tested using 660 responses from a field survey conducted in new delhi – the capital city of india – by using the structured equation modeling (sem) technique. the target respondents of the study are small businessmen and migrant laborers who are either underbanked or unbanked. findings: the findings of the study reveal that the model is able to explain 67.5 per cent of the variance in behavioral intention. the results indicate that all the factors are direct determinants of behavioral intention. perceived credibility is found to be the strongest influencer of behavioral intention. the findings also indicate that perceived credibility partially mediates the relationships between “social influence and behavioral intention” and “performance expectancy and behavioral intention.” the relationship between performance expectancy and behavioral intention is also found to be moderated by facilitating conditions and effort expectancy. research limitations/implications: as this study is based on a convenience sample of respondents of only one city of india, this could negatively reflect on the generalizability of results across other cities. moreover, the study has only focused on the perceptions of small businessmen and migrant laborers. this raises concerns regarding the applicability of the results for other segments of the current population that have different demographic characteristics (e.g. occupation, income, education level and technology experience). modifying the conceptual model presented in this research to include “experience” and “age” as moderators can also be worth considering in future. although this study has extended the utaut to include perceived credibility, the results of the explanatory power of the model indicate that there is still room for improvement. therefore, including other constructs, e.g. hedonic motivation, perceived risks and trialability, could be a fruitful path forward. future studies may also examine the factors influencing the actual use behavior of payments banks, rather than just behavioral intention. practical implications: the study looks forward to providing the payments banks service providers in india with suitable guidelines for effectively implementing and designing payments banks services. specifically, the results of this study have provided clues for indian payments banks service providers about the crucial role of perceived credibility in influencing the behavioral intention to adopt payments banks. therefore, service providers have to initially be sure that payments banks are able to conduct financial transactions efficiently, securely and within less time, along with the availability of information required by customers to successfully use the services. service providers should enhance customer confidence and trust by providing secure and reliable services. they should also emphasize on the positive safety measures of the payments banks during any marketing campaign rather than just creating brand awareness. originality/value: the study represents a substantial contribution to the existing knowledge regarding mobile payment channels in particular and technology acceptance area in general. in fact, this study presents a worthwhile direction by examining payments banks services, which, so far, have not been well evaluated in the indian context. to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is an early attempt toward a holistic and integrative approach to explain adoption of payments banks in india. although prior studies have addressed mobile banking and mobile payment adoption, the strength of this research lies in combining the utaut constructs with perceived credibility. this is evidenced by the high explanatory power (67.5 per cent) of the research model adopted in this study.', 'influence of artificial intelligence (ai) on firm performance: the business value of ai-based transformation projects. purpose: the main purpose of our study is to analyze the influence of artificial intelligence (ai) on firm performance, notably by building on the business value of ai-based transformation projects. this study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of ai and ai concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of ai-based solution providers; and (4) a review of ai literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of ai-enabled projects transformation within organizations. design/methodology/approach: this study has called on the theory of it capabilities to seize the influence of ai business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). the research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from ibm, aws, cloudera, nvidia, conversica, universal robots websites, etc. studying the influence of ai on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations’ ai-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase. findings: ai covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. organizations have been adopting ai technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. ai fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. thus, the results of our study have highlighted such ai benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. by building on these ai attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. the same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through ai capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes. research limitations/implications: ai obviously influences the way businesses are done today. therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider ai as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. for the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of ai within organizations. in terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of ai on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. as for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of ai, and therefore improve organizations’ performance, the profitability of their investments in ai transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. this study also allows managers to consider ai not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of it in the various company’s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of ai: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. originality/value: this article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from ai deployment reports in organizations. the transformation of projects based on the use of ai focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of ai-based projects and the impact of ai on firm performance. more specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of ai at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of it in various industries.']"

second, absorptive capacity plays a moderating role. on the one hand, high absorptive capacity brings about a better innovation environment and enhances the effects of carbon emission reduction; on the other hand, the application of industrial robots promotes carbon intensity reduction by positively influencing the improvement of green total factor productivity and energy intensity. finally, policy recommendations are provided based on the results.', ""the effect of artificial intelligence on carbon intensity: evidence from china's industrial sector. artificial intelligence (ai) is becoming the engine of a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation;

on convenience, the less time and effort, the better. the authors propose that ai has taken convenience to a new level for consumers. by using bots as their service of choice, consumers outsource their decisions to algorithms, hence give little attention to traditional consumer decision-making models and brand emphasis. at the moment, this is especially true for low involvement types of

purpose: microlearning has been considered as a promising topic in work-based learning. this paper aims to review the trends of microlearning in terms of related publications and internet searches. hopefully, the findings can serve as a reference for the education sector, government, business and academia to promote, design and use microlearning. design/methodology/approach: in this study, two sets of analysis were conducted. firstly, the authors analysed the publication trend of microlearning. second, the authors analysed the trend of internet searches related to microlearning. more specifically, the authors analysed real-world data of 14 years obtained from scopus and google trends for the purpose. these data include the first relevant publication found in the database. findings: in total, 476 relevant publications have been identified during 2006–2019. according to the findings from the analysis of the identified publications, microlearning is a relevantly new and emerging global topic involving authors, affiliations and funding sponsors from different countries. moreover, many microlearning-related publications were conducted from perspectives of e-learning or mobile learning. furthermore, the authors notice higher education was the most frequently mentioned education level in the identified publications. on the other hand, language learning (i.e. second language, vocabulary learning, etc.) had been mentioned more times in the titles and abstracts than other subject areas. overall, the increasing trend of publications on “microlearning” (as a knowledge supply) is in line with the established increasing internet searches of “microlearning” (as a practical demand) in recent years. practical implications: from the work-based learning perspective, microlearning has been considered as one of the key topics in talent development topics. policymakers, educators, researchers and participators have the responsibility to explore how to promote, design and use microlearning to help people to learn in the right direction through valid knowledge with ethical consideration. originality/value: although many works had been done on microlearning, there is a lack of comprehensive studies reviewing the trends of microlearning in terms of related publications and internet searches. this study aims to fill this gap by analysing real-world data obtained from scopus and google trends – these data include the first relevant publication found in the database. the authors believe this is the first time that a study has been conducted to comprehensively review the development trends of microlearning. hopefully, this study can shed some light on related research.', 'artificial intelligence in online higher education: a systematic review of empirical research from 2011 to 2020. as online learning has been widely adopted in higher education in recent years, artificial intelligence (ai) has brought new ways for improving instruction and learning in online higher education. however, there is a lack of literature reviews that focuses on the functions, effects, and implications of applying ai in the online higher education context. in addition, what ai algorithms are commonly used and how they influence online higher education remain unclear. to fill these gaps, this systematic review provides an overview of empirical research on the applications of ai in online higher education. specifically, this literature review examines the functions of ai in empirical researches, the algorithms used in empirical researches and the effects and implications generated by empirical research. according to the screening criteria, out of the 434 initially identified articles for the period between 2011 and 2020, 32 articles are included for the final synthesis. results find that: (1) the functions of ai applications in online higher education include prediction of learning status, performance or satisfaction, resource recommendation, automatic assessment, and improvement of learning experience; (2) traditional ai technologies are commonly adopted while more advanced techniques (e.g., genetic algorithm, deep learning) are rarely used yet; and (3) effects generated by ai applications include a high quality of ai-enabled prediction with multiple input variables, a high quality of ai-enabled recommendations based on student characteristics, an improvement of students’ academic performance, and an improvement of online engagement and participation. this systematic review proposes the following theoretical, technological, and practical implications: (1) the integration of educational and learning theories into ai-enabled online learning; (2) the adoption of advanced ai technologies to collect and analyze real-time process data; and (3) the implementation of more empirical research to test actual effects of ai applications in online higher education.']"

more evidence is still needed to judge whether digital transformation will have an impact upon the vulnerable employees in the economy. research limitations/implications: the paper focused on the impact of digital transformation upon total aggregate employment. future research is still needed to examine the impact upon the structure of the labor market and the shift of occupations. originality/value: the paper aims to add to in the literature regarding the relationship between digital transformation, economic development, employment and productivity in the developing world. the implications of those relationships are of significant importance to policymakers regarding how much support should be given to encourage the digital transformation. at the same time, it shall also indicate how much social support policies are required – if any – to lessen the negative impact of digital transformation on the vulnerable groups inside the country. another contribution is using a single composite index for digital transformation that is comparable across the chosen set of developing countries, instead of using single indices each capturing a different dimension of digital transformation.']"
