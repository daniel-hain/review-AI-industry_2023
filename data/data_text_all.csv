2-S2.0-85066019900,2019,"adoption of big data technology for innovation in b2b marketing. purpose of the paper: the paper explores use of big data in innovation and market leadership in b2b relationships. it provides a framework to analyze the impact of big data, supported by four case studies. methodology/approach: this is a conceptual paper, supported by case studies, offering the opportunity for concept generalization. the case study organizations are innovating to stay ahead in the market and to expand activity, using big data to exploit marketing opportunities and create new offerings. findings: organizations are recipients of and are collectors of big data, partly created by the increasing volume of business and customer transactions online. the qualitative exploration of the cases shows that big data and its analytics and applications can be taken as indicators of organizations’ ability to innovate to respond to market opportunities. research limitations/implications: the online marketing environment is a dynamic one, where organizations must innovate to survive. a limitation is that the cases in the paper do not deal with those lagging in innovation, for whom survival is an issue. the paper’s examples are limited to successful organizations where big data, data mining and analytics led to strategic business success. practical implications: b2b organizations that operate in markets where their own products or services have a significant impact on how the products and services of their b2b customers provide value to end (b2c) customers should, in their innovation activity, engage fully with the end b2c market, together with their b2b customers. this has implications in every area from strategy to human resources. if the b2b organization’s pedigree includes b2c activity parallel to that of their customers but not competitive, this can give them an advantage in marketing, but if their b2c activities start to encroach on the b2c activities of their customers, this may cause conflict and loss of business. this implies that if marketing strategy becomes siloed between the different branches of the business, the potential for conflict increases. originality/value of the paper: the paper’s value is in contributing to understanding big data’s role in business innovation, specifically in business to business organizations and where their innovation can transform customer experience at the end of the value chain, i.e., with final consumers. therefore, the paper helps to address a research gap in the literature, which tends to focus on how such innovation affects business-to-business relationships.",1,1.3679143758600583
2-S2.0-85073987977,2020,"supply chain 4.0: concepts, maturity and research agenda. purpose: industry 4.0 is one of the most emergent research topics attracting significant interest by researchers as well as practitioners. many articles have been published with regards industry 4.0; however, there is no research that clearly conceptualizes industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain. this paper aims to propose the term “supply chain 4.0” together with a novel conceptual framework that captures the essence of industry 4.0 within the supply chain context. as industry 4.0 is inherently a revolution, and as revolutions are evolutionary, this research also aims to capture the evolution of supply chain 4.0 from maturity levels perspective to facilitate the formulation and development of supply chain 4.0 strategy. design/methodology/approach: following a deductive research approach and a qualitative strategy, a systematic literature review (slr) was adopted as the research method seeking to understand the relationships among supply chain, industry 4.0 and maturity levels research. the three phases of the slr process utilized are: planning, conducting and reporting. a concept-oriented technique was applied to the outputs of the slr to obtain the key constructs that would facilitate the development of the conceptual supply chain 4.0 framework. findings: the slr showed that there is limited research linking industry 4.0 to supply chain. nevertheless, it was possible to extract a set of thematic categories from the analysis of the articles which are referred to as constructs as they form the core of the conceptual supply chain 4.0 framework. these constructs are managerial and capability supporters, technology levers, processes performance requirements and strategic outcomes. each of these constructs consists of a number of elements which are referred to as “dimensions” in this research and a total of 21 dimensions were identified during the slr. the slr also demonstrated that maturity propositions for industry 4.0 are still embrionary and entirely missing in the context of supply chain. hence, this research develops and proposes a maturity levels framework that is underpinned by the core constructs of supply chain 4.0 and the corresponding dimensions. as these proposed frameworks are conceptual, this research also identifies and proposes several research directions to help fortify the supply chain 4.0 concept. research limitations/implications: this research argues that the frameworks are robust because the constructs and dimensions are grounded in the literature, thus demonstrating both theoretical and practical relevance and value. as supply chain 4.0 research is still in infancy, there is a range of open research questions suggested based on the frameworks that could serve as guides for researchers to further develop the supply chain 4.0 concept. also, practitioners can use this framework to develop better understanding of supply chain 4.0 and be able to evaluate the maturity of their organizations. as the proposed frameworks are conceptual, they require further empirical research to validate them and obtain new insights. originality/value: the slr demonstrated a clear gap in literature with regards to industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain, and also in the context of industry 4.0 maturity levels for supply chain. this research is unique as it formulates and introduces novel frameworks that close these gaps in literature. the value of this research lies in the fact that it makes significant contribution in terms of understanding of supply chain 4.0 with a clear set of constructs and dimensions that form supply chain 4.0, which provides the foundation for further work in this area.",3,0.15602831120570537

2-S2.0-0942268003,2003,"temporarily divide to conquer: centralized, decentralized, and reintegrated organizational approaches to exploration and adaptation. to create a competitive advantage, firms need to find activity configurations that are not only internally consistent, but also appropriate given the firm's current environment. this challenge is particularly acute after firms have experienced an environmental change that has shifted the existing competitive landscape and created new, high-performing sets of activity choices. how should firms organize to explore and search such an altered performance landscape? while it has been noted that adaptive entities need to maintain a balance of exploration and exploitation, little is known about how different organizational structures moderate this balance. with the help of an agent-based simulation model, we study the value of three different organizational structures: a centralized organization, in which decisions are made only at the level of the firm as a whole; a decentralized organization, in which decisions are made independently in two divisions; and a temporarily decentralized firm, which starts out with a decentralized structure and later reintegrates. we find that if interactions among a firm's activities are pervasive, neither the centralized nor the permanently decentralized organizational structure leads to high performance. in this case, temporary decentralization - an organizational structure that has not found much attention in the literature - yields the highest long-term performance. this organizational structure allows the firm both to avoid low-performing activity configurations and to eventually coordinate across its divisions. thus, even if the decision problem a firm faces is not fully decomposable, a temporary bifurcation can lead to a higher long-term performance outcome. initial decentralized exploration is, however, costly in the short run, as compared to centralized exploration. as a result, a tradeoff exists between the short-term costs of decentralized exploration and the long-term benefits of reaching higher performance. as interactions across and within divisions increase, the optimal length of decentralized exploration tends to grow. paralleling our first result, we further show that even if a decision problem is decomposable, that is, can be perfectly modularized, it can be beneficial to create a temporary decision allocation that creates ""unnecessary"" interdependenciesacross the subsystems. this benefit arises in particular when the modules are complex by themselves. in both cases, an initial phase of exploration, enabled by an appropriate organizational structure, followed by refinement and coordination, enabled by a different structure, leads to high performance. to illustrate our general model, we focus on incumbent firms' responses to the internet and discuss implications for the product design process.",5,0.041806722689075634
